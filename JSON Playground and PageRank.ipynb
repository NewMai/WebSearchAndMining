Guderian was ahead of all the leading foreign military \"armoured specialists\", in the way armour was to be employed in the field, and went on to prove it in Germany's early successes of the war. Reading through some of the theories and strategies could, at times, be a little tedious. Being a history buff, I found the best parts to be the actual recounting of tank battles in WWI, how they failed/succeeded, and what could be learnt from them. What struck me most about this work is that it was written in a time when tanks were, at least by some, considered secondary to infantry. Tanks had only been used in relateively small numbers during WWI (compared with the actions that were to be seen in the following war), and were introduced later in the war (August, 1916). And these first tanks were slow, prone to mechanical failure, and difficult to handle over rough terrain. Consequently, the interwar years tanks were an untried weapon leading up to the outbreak of WWII, and the \"Blitzkrieg\" campaigns owed much of their success to (apart from Guderian) these fast, mechanically reliable, versitile machines, and the tank was never doubted again.\", \n",

Also it would be great to update the maps of the battles.Unfortunately for mankind, Guderian created, at the time, the best army in the world thanks to it\u00b4s revolutionary theories about the use of tanks and the creation of a mecanized independent tank brigade and the close cooperation between the panzer groups and the other military forces, creating the famous Blitzkrieg tatics that allowed german army to defeat the French army.Guderian made a superior analisys of the reasons for the collapse of the WW I german frontlines after the introduction of tanks by France, UK and USA, and explained why some of the advantages created by their use were not use in the best way, specially because the tank forces were subordinate to the infantry, were used only as a close support for infantry, conducted by officers from other army forces that were not experienced in their comand, loosing all the offensive push and tactical advantage and the fact that they were, at the begining, use in small numbers.Despite this, they were decisive in the battlefields, specially in the battles of Cambrai and Amiens in 1918, that forced Germany to request the armistice and ended the war.He also pointed out that despite the evidences in 1916 that the German army wasn\u00b4t prepare to face this new weapon, they did nothing to prevent it, specially in what concerned the creation of counter measures to face this new threat (anti-tank weapons, direct artillery fire, tanks) mostly because of the german army doctrine (and also in some allied forces) that the king of the battlefield was the infantry, and the persistence in using cavalry, when they were, at the time, completely outdated thanks to the machine guns.Thanks to Guderian revolutionary analysis and ideas, the german army was umbeatable in the battlefields until they invaded USSR in Operation Barbarossa, in 22 June 1941 and the declaration of war to the USA in December of the same year.\", \n",

He in the text he first of all goes into exact detail on a number of battles from the First World War.   Not necessarily the famous one's but battles that slowly build up a picture of the First World War methods used by the then infant tank troops.  Then, he takes us through the developments after the First World War, concentrating on how Britian, France and Russia adapted the armoured warfare concept.  Finally, he states the way he believes the next war should be fought.  That of using the tank as the primary weapon to achieve victory.It is very prophetic reading through his proposals and seeing just how many were applied by the Panzer forces, almost to the letter.  In turn, some of his predictions on how enemies would react are spot-on.  It is no wonder, reading through this book, that the Germany tank forces and indeed military as a whole were so successful during the opening years of the Second World War.For military buff's, this is a must read and exceptionally well translated.  An excellent book.\", \n",

The text is certainly phrophetic with the rise of armoured vehicles' importance in modern warfare with their emphasis on speed, armour, and radios (communication and coordination), which is quite the leap from trenches and fixed artillery positions from years before. Not only that, but two years after this book was published World War II started and the same tactics Guderian outlines in his text are used. A lot of technical details make this read not necessarily a \"pleasure\" read, but scholars and history buffs will love Guderian's in-depth analysis (also, the ending of the book ends on an interesting flourish commonly found in ancient Greek texts, where the writer invokes the favour of the gods for victory, revealing Guderian's classical education, common for officers in that era, adding a personal touch to this purposeful study). This book is well worth it if you have an interest in World War I and World War II history.\", \n",

Achtung-Panzer! is a military classic and a good read. As a primmer, I would recommend \"Kaiserschlacht 1918\" by  Randal Gray from Osprey Publishing. The  Ludendorff Offensive represented a paradigm shift in war-fighting, and helped shape Guderian's views on the importance of armor, maneuver warfare, adaptability and initiative.
