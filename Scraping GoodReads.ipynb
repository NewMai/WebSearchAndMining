Henry has delighted readers with its humor, irony and colorful, real-life settings. The writer's own life had more than a touch of color and irony. Born William Sidney Porter in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1862, he worked on a Texas ranch, then as a bank teller in Austin, then as a reporter for the Houston \"Post.\" Adversity struck, however, when he was indicted for embezzlement of bank funds. Porter fled to New Orleans, then to Honduras before he was tried, convicted and imprisoned for the crime in 1898. In prison he began writing stories of Central America and the American Southwest that soon became popular with magazine readers. After his release Porter moved to New York City, where he continued writing stories under the pen name O.HenryThough his work earned him an avid readership, O. Henry died in poverty and oblivion scarcely eight years after his arrival in New York. But in the treasury of stories he left behind are such classics of the genre as \"The Gift of the Magi,\" \"The Last Leaf,\" \"The Ransom of Red Chief,\" \"The Voice of the City\" and \"The Cop and the Anthem\" \u2014 all included in this choice selection.

It is peppered with little tidbits about the delegates (like fishing habits or what they wrote home to their children) that give them personality and humanity.  Told in simple and straightforward language, it also hits on all of the hot-button topics that would ultimately lead to four months of deliberation and debate: state rights, representation, slavery, how to choose a president, etc.  I also gained a better sense of the important distinction between the terms \"national\" (a central government with power over the states) and \"federal\" (a government of an association of states that give up none of their individual rights).  The original Constitution never used the word \"national\" because it was so offensive to many of the delegates.  Our states therefore were joined into a federation, and not a nation, to create the United States of America.  Overall, an enjoyable and educational read.  The full text (and it's not very long) of the original Constitution is included at the end of the book. \"We the people\" never fails to inspire a little thrill of pride.\", \n",

Unfortunately, Fritz does not use the term New Jersey Plan to describe the part of the Great Compromise that create the balance in the Senate that we have.  The plan is described accurately, just not named so.One gains a pretty good feel for the struggle our forefathers had in crafting our government.  We learn of the different sides of terms like federal and national.  And we see how some were not in favor of a federal government preferring the states to remain sovereign (can you hear me, George Mason?).

That is a horrific fact, but there are occasional such engagements for young readers. Details about the first July 4th parade and celebration in Philadelphia were great too!However, as I read this book, with all my background knowledge about the Constitution, I wasn't fully engaged on every page. I continue to realize how important passion and choice are for students. If a student is interested in government and specifically the U.S. Constitution, this book would be awesome.

We missed such an important part of American history! This book teaches us such key topics that I feel students should know, like how to pick a president, state rights, slavery, and representation. America had succeeded from England, then they had to write an entire constitution! This book is an easy way to explain to students what our founding fathers went through to make our country what it is today. It also eases the passage way from  the Revolutionary War to the Civil War, since they had to make some changes to the constitution after the civil war, for instance: abolishing slavery.\", \n",

My boys were able to understand the Virginia plan and why the smaller states had issues with some things.  The book briefly touched on the conflict between Northern and Southern states as well.It'd difficult to condense everything that was said and all the personalities into one book for children.  Fritz did a good job.  While I think this is a good choice, I will continue to try to find one I like better.  But I wouldn't hesitate to use this again.\", \n",
