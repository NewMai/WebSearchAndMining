I wanted to like it - popular book set in small town Virginia - I like Virginia, I miss Virginia. I'd really love a good book set in Virginia. Someone let me know where I can find one.Partial list of things I hate:1) The voice seems fake. I know the author grew up in Big Stone Gap. I know people in Virginia are out to whatever location they're at. There's still something so fake and...fake...about the narrator's voice.2) After I read a lot of it, I noticed that the quoted blurbs on the cover are from - Whoopi Goldberg. Fannie Flagg. Rosanne Cash. I respect Whoopi Goldberg, but if I ever get a book published, I hope to have something better to put on the cover than \"Whoopi Goldberg liked it.\"3) There's a reader's guide in the back. I hate those. And an interview of the author - by a character in the book! How clever smug!5) A short passage from late in the book, as we travel Italy with the narrator: \"The people here are so animated; they raise their voices to make a point, they use their bodies for emphasis; they are so full of life and comical! It is no surprise that the commedia dell'arte theatrical tradition started here in the fourteenth century.\" By the way, this book has nothing to do with commedia dell'arte. NOTHING.6) The main character's behavior and motivations are beyond stupid. A guy sells his truck to buy plane tickets for relatives to visit her, and she doesn't know if he loves her. Also the man she thinks she loves is ostensibly not gay, but is gay, but even the author seems not to know it. Honey, whoever you based this character on in real life is gay, and that's OK, but you probably should know that. Writers are supposed to be perspicacious and all.7) You know what never grows deep inside caves? ANYTHING (including moss).8) It was a best seller, and led to a series, apparently. I think I'm going to vomit again."}, {"userName": "Stina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/650424-stina", "userReview": "I am so sick of female characters who are confused with their lives and themselves and have to stomp off when someone is trying to tell them something.

But I was more than a little disappointed. I found the writing to be trite, and the characters' behavior too often inexplicable.This book is supposedly about how Ave Maria, the \"town spinster\" of Big Stone Gap, finds herself and finds love over the course of a year. I suppose that she does, but there were too many improbable things in the story to make either of her discoveries believable.One discovery that is believable: after her mother dies, Ave Maria is given a letter that her mother wrote and left in the care of her lawyer. The letter explains that the man Ave Maria has thought of as her father (who died many years before the story begins), isn't, and that her real father is an Italian man that her mother had to leave behind when she became pregnant. So far, fine. Part of what results is that the family of her erstwhile father come clamoring for what they see is now their inheritance, including the house Ave Maria grew up in and the pharmacy business she now owns and runs. What does Ave Maria do? Rather than fighting this based on the fact that her father's will gave all of his property to her mother, who then gave it to her (although this is mentioned), Ave Maria chooses to protect the assets from the grubbing relatives by transferring the whole thing to her 16-year-old assistant! And as if that weren't improbable enough, she then begins to separate herself from the every-day running of the business and leaves it in the teenager's \"capable hands\"!Moving on. At 35, Ave Maria is thought of by the town and by herself as a spinster. She prizes herself on her independence, although she wishes she could fall in love with someone who would want to marry her. But, when someone she's known since childhood suddenly proposes to her, she says no, thinking that he's only asking her out of pity, or is playing some kind of trick on her (this I found eminently believable, because if someone up and proposed to me without any sign that they had any special feelings for me, I'd feel the same way!). The man in question gets mightily offended, but doesn't stop trying. Unfortunately, he also doesn't really do anything to demonstrate that he's loved her since they were children (we don't find this out until much later). So why should either we, as readers, much less Ave Maria, believe that he's madly in love with her? Apparently, all her friends knew he was in love her, but we're not told any single thing that he did to demonstrate it. What's more, they apparently knew that she was in love with him, even though we're not told what she may have said or done to give that away. And, none of them will tell her what they've so sneakily observed. Ave Maria does eventually feel all the love, and they get married quickly, and seem very happy. Which is great. Except I don't believe it."}, {"userName": "Snap", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2995611-snap", "userReview": "I really enjoyed Big Stone Gap and was delighted to learn that this is the first in the series of novels featuring the folks of Big Stone Gap, Virginia.

I don't think it belongs in the chick-lit or romance genre, because to me, it is so much more than either one, but \"heartwarming\" definitely fits. Lots of surprises and a whole cast of quirky, small-town characters to fall in love with. This book made me laugh and cry, even while trying to fall back to sleep listening to it in the middle of the night. The town and its people became real to me and Ave's story is worth reading. The audiobook is performed by the author, and I can also highly recommend it.

The funny thing is that I have evolved in these past years and I have enjoyed this book for different reasons. I like and I don't like Ave Maria because she's too hard on herself and sometimes even, contrary to what the book pretends, on others. I understand protecting yourself out of self preservation, but in my mind Ave Maria acts more out of ignorance. She's so naive at times! Luckily Ave Maria is growing up. I was thoroughly touched by the reflections that were made about knowing your parents and then knowing yourself. It truly remains a charming book with true and flawed characters, I highly appreciate the ensemble of colorful & amazing characters."}, {"userName": "Debra Anne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21644061-debra-anne", "userReview": "This feel-good story is set in the Virginia hills, with a charming cast of small-town personalities that revolve around the narrator, one Ave Maria whose Italian mother had her out of wedlock and brought her up in bluegrass country. So why didn't I give it a higher rating? Despite the exuberance of the narrator, this is still basically a book with a plotline I hate -- Whiney bitch out to find herself. Typical of these plotlines, Ave Maria, has at least one person madly in love with her -- to the point that the poor fellow sells his spanking new pickup truck in order to buy her an expensive surprise. As usual, I have trouble relating to the problems that push these personalities to the brink. Okay, her beloved mother has recently died, and she has discovered that her stepfather isn't her real dad, and she has a wicked step aunt lurking at the edges of the narrative trying to take her step-inheritance away from her. But honestly, is this enough to make someone collapse into a seven-day sleep? Not in my universe.In fairness, I will say that Ave Maria's narrative voice is too exuberant to qualify as pure whiny bitch, and she manages to give a lot to the community and people around her despite her preoccupation with herself and her apparent frailty when it comes to dealing with life. Maybe it's because up until her mother's illness, she hasn't had any real blows except for a gnawing suspicion that the man she thought was her father didn't love her. The father issue, by the way, seems to be the underpinning of the whole narrative -- because she didn't feel \"protected\" by a father figure, she cannot commit to love. I think that is the other problem I have with this cheerful, easy-reading book. Everyone in it is too darn nice, and they all watch over Ave Maria, waiting for her to come to her senses -- not just one village of Ave Maria admirers, but two, one in Italy and one in Big Stone Gap. Ave Maria is the center of everyone's universe as well as her own, and I found that plain irritating not to mention downright unreal."}, {"userName": "Vasia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2310888-vasia", "userReview": "I read this book a few years back in a single day, and though i'm hazy on the details , it has left me a warm and fuzzy feeling.

Ave Maria is in her mid-30s and is worried about becoming an old maid, so gets serious about acquiring a love life. I appreciated some of the details of her life as a pharmacist, town theater producer, emergency response team member, and all around do gooder. Her lusty friend who runs a bookmobile, Iva Lou, advises her on romance strategies:\u201cThere ain\u2019t nothing like a working man..When you\u2019ve known as many men as me, you start making lists. The working man is a solid man. They can fix things that are broke. They\u2019re practical. \u2026Those men that sit behind a desk all day, the office types, stay away from them. They are the weirdos of the world. They don\u2019t get out and get air and get physical every day, so their blood pools in their brains, and they get very strange sexual ideas, believe you me. Kinky. I mean it.\u201dYet the men of interest seem to zig when she zags, and she eventually comes to believe commitment requires tracking down her biological father in Italy first. I didn\u2019t really understand that. A number of decisions by the characters are abrupt and implausible, leading me more toward mystification rather than humor or wisdom. By comparison, I get more of both from the work of Billie Letts and Alexander McCall Smith, which both work a comparable cozy world of quirky characters. For rural life, I get more wisdom of the heart from the work of Kent Haruf."}, {"userName": "Booker Hookers", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48182469-booker-hookers", "userReview": "As a group, our overall rating for Big Stone Gap is 3 stars.Things we liked:Every member of our book club enjoyed the realistic description of the setting and small town vibe. We have one particular member who is from just outside the real city of Big Stone Gap, and she fully related to every detail, especially the characters, who reminded her of actual people she knew. She pointed out that Appalachian people were represented realistically, as hard-working folks with hopes, dreams, and big hearts. We all also found the last 3/4 of the book to be the best, the romance giving us the warm fuzzies.What we didn't like so much was that it was so sloooooow to start with. We didn't find any big \"oh, wow\" moments to sink our teeth into from the get-go. Some of the scenes did also feel choppy, bouncing around a bit with no discernable destination. Also, since we are nurses by day, we all found ourselves a bit thrown by the non-realistic way some things were portrayed. (No spoilers.)General thoughts: Big Stone Gap is a leisurely book with some enjoyable bits and fun characters that's true message is about a woman's journey to find herself, reminding us to take part in our own lives instead of just watching it slip by. It did manage to evoke some emotion, but lacked the \"wow\" factor for us.

This book was being promoted by the publisher in conjunction with a movie debuting in October 2015. I have heard nothing about the movie, so I am assuming it was a flop. After reading this book, I am trying to think of a reason for making a movie of it. The leading character is nearing her 36th birthday, but seemed as childish as a 15 year old. Ave Maria Mulligan (isn't that an awful name?) apparently is beautiful, smart and industrious, but has never had a boyfriend. The reasoning given is as clear as mud. Why Ave Maria makes the decisions she makes in her personal life are incomprehensible. Many of the characters are caricatures of southern hillbillies, which should insult the inhabitants of southwest Virginia.I would not have finished the book if it were not being discussed at our local library book club this month.

The cast of characters includes all the quirky lovable types that you would expect in a book like this. The story follows Ave Maria, a single Italian-American woman, as she turns 35 and the following year in her life. I found her character to be very likable and could easily relate to her. The discoveries Ave Maria makes about herself and women in general I thought were insightful and interesting. I liked this book because: (1) the character has several love interests that are all really good guys. No one ruined their chances with Ave Maria by doing something wrong. I had no idea who she would end up with until the very end. (2) It was a good romance book that was rated PG. I only gave it 4 stars because although it was a fun read, it wasn't incredibly mind-blowing. In a year, I probably won't remember the plot.Overall a fun fast read.

The author\u2019s reading was a distraction and not a good one. The main character of Ave Maria Mulligan, the thirty-five year old town pharmacist (and town spinster), is a hot mess. She has a good life, but she learns something after the death of her mother that sends her into a tailspin and searching for something that even she is not sure of. Ave Maria lectures a lot, to the reader and to other characters, which gets old after a while. A-M is not really a pleasant person; she lacks maturity and makes assumptions that cause her to belligerently blast others. There are colorful Southern characters such as Pearl Grimes, Fleeta Mullins, and Jack Mac threaded throughout the book. The novel was a slow unfolding of a period of change in A-M\u2019s life.

Through her face-readings, we come to understand the hostilities simmering within her family: her father whose small eyes are the clear \"sign of a deceptive nature.\" Her aunt who \"has a small head and thin lips. (That's a terrible combination.)\" Adriana Trigiani's first novel concerns the family scandals that befall Ave Maria in this seemingly uneventful town. Greed, lust, envy--all the ancient emotional elements--manifest themselves even in this hamlet of \"ordinary folk.\" Fans of Fannie Flagg or Rebecca Wells will enjoy this down-home tale, full of small, everyday details and colloquial revelations. The writing is often awkward, but so too are the characters who inhabit this place: the Bookmobile lady who thinks of herself as the sexiest woman alive; the amateur actors in the local Outdoor Drama who bristle with ambition when they hear that Elizabeth Taylor is coming to visit. In Big Stone Gap, her visit is so anticipated, it's like she's an angel sent from heaven. --Ellen Williams", "title": "Big Stone Gap\n      \n          (Big Stone Gap #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap?rto=x_gr_w_carousel_bp", "average": 3.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1527083506l/40198373.jpg", "reviews": 2703, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9219.Adriana_Trigiani", "name": "Adriana Trigiani"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Romance", "Adult Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58822.Big_Stone_Gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17982010-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25614321-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13154638-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/835880.Big_Stone_Gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/676810.Big_Stone_Gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13127599-the-shoemaker-s-wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52471.Big_Cherry_Holler", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057.Lucia_Lucia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3673357-very-valentine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6673171-brava-valentine"]}
