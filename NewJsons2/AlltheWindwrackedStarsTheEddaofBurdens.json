Elisabeth Bear has been on my to-read list for years and she has a ton of books that have received decent acclaim. It also sounded like it would be a cool blend of fantasy, sci-fi, and Norse mythology. Sadly, I could not get into the story and found the book a total bore. Bear's distant writing style definitely did not help.I persisted with this for as long as I could, but decided to quit around the 50% mark as I just had no desire to return to the book when I put it down. I found I just did not care about the happenings in the story or any of the characters. There is no worse crime for a book than for it to be one that I avoid trying to read! In all fairness it was more boring than awful.All in all this was a big disappointment. DNF'd 50% Rating: 2 stars.

The language is beyond beautiful. The story is told in the manner of an epic poem, without the verse. This is the stuff of myth and legend and that is reflected in the style. The reader doesn't really connect to the characters, but can one really ever connect to legends?I ended up downgrading this story by one star for a couple of reasons. First, about halfway through the book, I realized that I was so caught up with the way Bear was telling the story that I missed some of the setup for the main action. I had to flip back a few time to figure out what was going on. Second, the time spans encompassed in this story were confusing and I it seemed to me that I never knew how much time had passed. Characters would be in one place for what seemed like months, but they got back to where they had been in a few days. If you're one of those people who checks out where readers shelve books, you'll see that I've put this on both my fantasy and sci-fi shelves. All the Windwracked Stars is mostly fantasy, but it has the stuff of science fiction going on in it too. It's supposed to be the first book in a trilogy, but it stands well on its own. It's a challenging read, beautifully done. It reminded me a lot of Perdido Street Station by China Mi\u00e9ville. If you liked that book, you should like this one as well."}, {"userName": "Gamma Mouse", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1568947-gamma-mouse", "userReview": "Occasionally, a novel can be greatly appreciated without being appealing. Like a piece of art in which one can enjoy the beauty and craftsmanship, but feel no connection with it. No matter how hard one tries, the novel and reader never engage each other; there is only an emotional flatness, a seed of a story that never germinates. Sometimes certain books don\u2019t work with certain readers. This is not a criticism as much as an observation. What doesn\u2019t emotionally connect with one reader could just as likely connect with the next one.Case in point is Elizabeth Bear\u2019s latest novel \u201cAll the Windwracked Stars.\u201d Bear\u2019s novel is beautifully written and expertly plotted, yet the story failed to engage me, lessening the overall appeal of the book for me. There were moments when I got into the story, only to have later events jar me back out of it. However, there was never a point in \u201cAll the Windwracked Stars\u201d where the book grabbed hold and refused to let go. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like the book due to Bear\u2019s sublime craftsmanship, \u201cAll the Windwracked Stars\u201d never generated any interest in me; it was an emotional flatline. But that isn\u2019t to say that it wouldn\u2019t generate interest in others. It contains all the elements necessary to be very successful with readers; I\u2019m just not one of them. As the novel begins, Muire stumbles across the aftermath of an apocalyptic battle between the children of the Light and the tarnished. She sadly discovers that all of her brothers and sisters of the Light have been killed, leaving her as the lone survivor of the Light. Muire is understandably crushed by this discovery. She is also wracked with enormous guilt, since she owes her survival to the fact that she fled like a coward before the battle began.Among the corpses littering the battlefield, Muire discovers the valraven Kasimir, barely alive. Kasimir is an extremely intelligent type of stallion that has two heads and wings. The valravens traditionally serve as mounts for the children of Light. Among the cold and snowy field of death, Muire and Kasimir end up eventually saving each other (both literally and metaphorically), creating a timeless bond in the process. Twenty-three hundred years later, human civilization has risen and nearly fallen, humanity now poised on the brink of extinction. Two hundred years earlier, the Desolation \u201cleft all Valdyrgard a salted garden.\u201d Only the ancient city of Eiledon currently survives due to the magical guardianship of the Technomancer. But it too is now failing.Muire, who has been living in Eiledon since before the Desolation, stumbles across a man dying in the streets one night. She takes in his last breath, sucking it down deep into her lungs, a waelcyrge rite by which she chooses him. In choosing him, Muire \u201caccepted his death and accepted as well the burden of vengeance that death brought.\u201d But this vengeance comes with a heavy price, and Muire suddenly finds herself in the heart of a complex mystery. One in which the outcome may affect the very survival of human civilization.Muire, the protagonist of \u201cAll the Windwracked Stars,\u201d was the biggest hindrance to my enjoyment of the book. Due to her guilt over her desertion of the children of Light twenty-three hundred years prior, Muire is emotionally crippled, filled with so much self-hatred that she is more annoying rather than endearing. Her woe-is-me act wore thin quickly. I generally am bored by mopey, angst-ridden characters, so Muire\u2019s inability to \u201cget over it\u201d didn\u2019t make for the most exciting reading. Thematically, \u201cAll the Windwracked Stars\u201d concentrates on the Muire\u2019s possible salvation. Can her future actions erase the stain of her past negligence? While I can appreciate this question, her emotional trauma bored me; I felt no empathy for her character. Many of the other characters in the novel like Selene, Kasimir, Cristokos, and Cathoair are quite appealing though. Only Muire undermines the narrative by wallowing in her angst. If she had only spanked her inner emo, \u201cAll the Windwracked Stars\u201d would have been very special. The world of \u201cAll the Windwracked Stars\u201d is highly imaginative and creative; the world-building and characterization is generally fresh and unique. Bear\u2019s creativity is wonderful to behold as it informs even the smallest detail of Valdyrgard. The language is beautiful; passages are poetic in their composition. Bear writes with an artist\u2019s sense of language; prose that is elevated above normal genre fiction. For example, Bear writes:\u201cSince the breaking of the Light the wolf has been listening to the ticking decay. Worlds, like gods, are a long time dying, and the deathblow dealt the children of the Light did not stop a civilization of mortal men from rising in their place, inventing medicine and philosophy, metallurgy and space flight.\u201dAesthetically, the novel is a wonder to behold. I was awed intellectually by Bear\u2019s imagination. Only my issues with Muire kept me from fully connecting with the world. If the focus had been shifted onto another character, I likely would have found the material much more engaging. I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to care about Muire.Last Word:Despite being beautifully composed and crafted, \u201cAll the Windwracked Stars\u201d failed to connect with me. The angst-ridden protagonist Muire is too weepy, her consuming self-hatred too melodramatic and boring. Therefore, I found myself having a difficult time relating to her, and as she serves as the main conduit for the story, this obviously hampered my enjoyment of the novel. This is really a personal objection more than a criticism though. Despite my distaste for Muire, \u201cAll the Windwracked Stars\u201d is still a wonderfully imaginative and enjoyable novel."}, {"userName": "Mpauli", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8323869-mpauli", "userReview": "\"Welcome to \"Books with Charactrs\".

The novel is a very original blend of fantasy, science fiction, steampunk and mythology, and while it has some weaknesses, its originality sets it apart in a genre that's all too often filled with cookie-cutter material.Surprisingly, All the Windwracked Stars actually begins with Ragnarok, the final battle between the Children of the Light and the Tarnished. Muire, a waelcyrge (valkyrie) is one of the only survivors, together with Kasimir, another valkyrie's wounded valraven, who (in a sign of things to come) is transformed from his old two-headed, winged horse form into a more steampunk-ish guise.Fast forward more than two millennia, to a post-apocalyptic world in which humanity only has one semi-viable city left. Eiledon is ruled by the Technomancer, who lives in a university/fortress floating above the city, and enforces her rule over the general population with a force of \"unmans\" (animal/human hybrids). Early in the novel, Muire learns that Mingan the Wolf is still stalking the world, and that the Technomancer's goals may not be entirely benevolent.All the Windwracked Stars is a challenging but ultimately rewarding novel \u2014 challenging, because it takes a good 200 pages before the plot really emerges. Until that happens, you're reading a novel set in a world that's so unique it can be confusing, populated by characters that are extremely hard to connect with, especially in the first handful of chapters. The original setting, combined with Elizabeth Bear's beautiful prose, will carry patient readers to the point where the story really takes off, but it's hard not to feel that this novel could have been more accessible.Regardless of this, All the Windwracked Stars is amazingly successful at combining mythology and science fiction in an intriguing and unique way. If you are interested in Norse mythology, and your tolerance for challenging reads is high, this book will deliver for you in spades.(My review was also published at www.fantasyliterature.com)"}, {"userName": "Maggie K", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2904850-maggie-k", "userReview": "Elizabeth Bear has some of the most lyrical writing I have ever read, simply beautiful, and it puts you right into the scene...you can feel the snow, or the heat of the steed.

But can she simply live out her days and watch the world end? WIll she have to do something to try and save it? I found her indecision very humane.She finds another Child of Light still alive, and determined to have the world end.

This one really was a winner. I admit that I'm a sucker for a female protagonist, especially of the gritty persuasion, and in that respect Muire doesn't disappoint. And talk about a flawed hero! She was the LONE Valkyrie to run away from the Ragnarok. The first one at least. This book is about her saving the world from the second. And it features a villain with human and justifiable motivations. How lacking in sci-fi/fantasy! My own quibble was that I wish it would have been a bit longer. Bear is a sparse writer, and I wish she would have taken a bit more time fleshing out the world. Still, great none the less, and I can't wait for the prequel in Fall 09!"}, {"userName": "Paul Weimer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1925269-paul-weimer", "userReview": "Elizabeth Bear is an audacious, difficult, and ultimately rewarding author. There are good reasons why she won a Campbell award, and a Hugo award. She's ambitious, writes characters who are all-too-human, and is very willing to take standard pieces of the F/SF genre, and rework them, remix myth and Story into it, and come out with books and stories that bite.All the Windwracked Stars is the latest in that tradition. Informed and infused by Norse mythology, the novel begins with, paradoxically, a Ragnarok. We meet Muire, last of the Valkyrie, and Kasimir, the Valraven steed that bonds to her in the denouement of that final battle. Muire the Historian, to her shame, does not die as the rest of the Children of the Light do, and so lives on and on to see civilization, this time a human one, arise again on Valdyrgard. As you might expect, with a novel based so heavily on Norse stories, and given Bear's writing proclivities and style, the novel carries us headlong toward the inevitable fall of this human civilization.It is between these two falls of civilizations that the meat of the novel and the Story take place. Muire still has her Valkyrie obligations, and it is in the unfolding of those obligations that Muire encounters an old enemy, and discovers the real reason why Eiledon, the last city, has managed to survive until the end under its implacable, mysterious ruler, the Technomancer. Norse Myth and Mythology. Strange technology and a Last City set in blasted landscape. Complex characters muddling along as best they can. Muire seeks a chance at redemption, a strong and potent theme in the novel, reflected across the range of characters. And while it might not be a crackerjack straightforward plot, Bear hauntingly and memorably creates Valdyrgard and Eiledon and its denizens. I've said in other reviews that Bear's work is probably not for everyone, or every SF reader. However, given that she is at the cutting edge of the newest generation of SF writers, if you want to see why the \"young turks\" of SF are doing with the genre, Bear is a strong choice for you to find that out. In an publishing age where Fantasy is ascendant over its technologically inclined brother, its refreshing, encouraging, and joyful to find a writer who does write fantasy (e.g. The Promethean age novels), but who is also willing to write darned good science fiction, with no apologies. And more importantly than just being willing to write science fiction, but to be very good at it. Barq's Root Beer has a tagline: \"Barq's Got Bite!\". I would say, however, having read a number of her novels, and especially after reading this one, that \"Bear's Got Bite!\"."}, {"userName": "Ambrosia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1811588-ambrosia", "userReview": "I'm a little torn on this one.I really liked what this book was trying to do: tell a postapocalyptic - or perhaps just apocalyptic - story based on a somewhat-modernized, somewhat-vintage version of the Norse mythology of Ragnarok. The semi-poetic language and worldbuilding through the eyes of someone who'd been around since the original Ragnarok (and therefore views technology through the lens of magic) was well-done.Unfortunately, I have only a passing familiarity with Norse mythology in general, and almost nothing with Ragnarok or the Valkyrie specifically. And, unsurprisingly, the impressionistic poeticism of the language didn't really lend itself well to exposition. So more than once I found myself going \"Wait. What just happened? What's going on? This latest plot development is obviously important, but what does it all mean? A little help for a non-classically-educated American, here?\"I also found the main character rather frustrating. For all that she's a Valkyrie and thousands of years old, she seems to have spent the bulk of that time being passive and angsty, and that carries over into this story, too - the bulk of it reads as rare bursts of action interspersed with moping and occasional flashbacks. Towards the end, when she finally gets up off her butt and does something, she (and her equally-frustrating compatriots) becomes much more interesting, but until then I found the story a bit of a slog.Still, it's well written and thoroughly researched, and the ending works well enough that I was willing to forgive a good chunk of the slogging.

The conscious loveliness of her prose seemed to me to cover a hollowness of meaning. Do you remember the TV show Angel? When Angel's detective pal asks Angel why he keeps fighting in the face of the true, certain knowledge that life sucks and then you die, and none of it means a damn thing, he replies, \"If nothing that we do matters, then all that matters is what we do.\" It's the sort of positive, life-affirming cousin to nihilism, and every single one of this book's characters seem to subscribe to the same philosophy.

And I was not dissapointed! This is a sweeping, elegant story that meshes technology with ancient mythology. There's a bit of melodrama, but I think that just goes hand in hand with the whole \"valkyrie\" theme, and its really not overbearing. A quick spoiler-free synopsis: the last valkyrie, long coping with guilt and loss, tracks a sinister and ancient foe through a high-tech city. But not all is as it seems, and the weary angel is in for a few shocks. The book definitely has the feel of an epic about it. I actually thought it was self contained, though now I see its the first in a series. I think it speaks quite well of the book it could pass as a stand-alone.The ending is poignant as all get out, seriously one of the best I've read in a long time. I do believe I teared up a little.

Elizabeth Bear\u2019s All the Windwracked Stars has all of the above and more. She uses mythology loosely to construct her world and if you are familiar with Odin\u2019s crew of Gods and immortals, you will recognize their integration into Bear\u2019s world, her characters and usage of language.Our fantasy adventure begins with the end. It\u2019s the end for the Children of Light and their world \u2013 survived only by Muire, a waelcyrge (valkyrie), and Kasimir, a valraven (two-headed, winged, war-steed). Muire, who thinks of herself as the \u201cleast\u201d of all her sisters, is not a warrior; instead she is a poet, historian and artist. She survives by fleeing that final battle where all her sisters and brothers \u2013 the einherjar or immortal warriors -- die. That single act of cowardice, the guilt and shame Muire carries with her, become the driving force behind her actions throughout this story.Fast forward twenty three hundred years later and the world is again dying. This time, surprise, surprise it is a world of men, who after rising and inventing medicine, philosophy, space flight and metallurgy now live in an era known as the Desolation, under the Defile \u2013 a contaminated earth full of deserts and bleached bones, un-breathable air and a dead sea killed by bio-weapons and never ending wars. Only one city remains, Eiledon.When Muire finds a truman dying in the shadows of darkness, with no traces of blood or bodily harm, she recognizes the manner of death and knows the killer. An old, powerful evil from long ago has returned and she must hunt it and kill it, or die trying.The gloom and doom that permeate the world Bear constructs makes this a tough read through the first third of the book. Muire\u2019s self-recrimination, guilt and sense of worthlessness, while understandable, were tough to deal with at times. Thank goodness for Kasimir who serves as her conscience and represents the hope and promise of a possible future. He has the faith in Muire that she doesn\u2019t have in herself, and recognizes the courage and Light she possesses. Although Muire is the main character, and a strong one at that, once Bear\u2019s well-developed and fascinating secondary characters start to emerge, I became immersed in her world. They were the ones that made this story work for me.Thjierry Thorvaldsdottir, Technomancer of Eiledon, is known as the savior of the dying city. A combination techie/witch, she reigns supreme in the Tower, a floating bubble-like city she created \u2013 a city above a city -- adored by her students and guarded by loyal servants, the moreau or unmen -- animals with human-like abilities. Thjierry and Muire might be the only hope left for Eiledon. The unmen play a small, if key, part in the story. Selene, the cat girl with her claws, whip and smarts, is the most memorable of the unmen characters. I was touched by her toughness, vulnerability and courage \u2013 a definite reminder of H.G. Wells\u2019 \u201cThe Island of Dr. Moreau.\u201dMingan, the Grey Wolf is a tarnished predator, traitor to all, but most of all to himself. He is a dark, fascinating character that took hold of my imagination and didn\u2019t let go, even after the book was finished. Possibly my favorite in this book, his is the character that brings us the closest to the tragedy and duality that we often find in Norse mythology. Based on a cross between Fenrir the Wolf and Hati, the sun-eater, Mingan, together with Cathoair, a young male prostitute and bar fighter, take over the page whenever they appear. Theirs is a complex relationship --Mingan hunts Cathoair, whom he both loves and hates and in turn, Cathoair haunts Mingan. Cathoair is both more and less than he appears to be. By becoming important to both Muire and the Grey Wolf, he also becomes a catalyst and central to this story.As the story unfolded, defining the Dark and the Light became difficult, gray areas expanded and I found myself reading slower, savoring every moment, not wanting the book to end. And as I concluded my journey with Muire and her ragtag group of friends and foes, after experiencing depths of despair and selfishness, the power of friendship and love, I found that in the end, this book was mostly about redemption and self-sacrifice.There is potential in this world for other great adventures. Hopefully, Elizabeth Bear will give us more. If you like Fantasy, Sci-Fi and mythology, this book is certainly for you."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca", "userReview": "I loved the experience of reading this book, but find myself puzzled now at its end.This is a gorgeous piece of writing, with some dazzlingly inventive conceits. Bear drops you right into the second end of the world, on a plain covered by dying angels. We then fast forward to a world devastated a second time, this time after a man-made apocalypse. The writing is lonely and poignant and lovely. The characters--Muire the Valkyrie who abandoned her comrades and so is doomed to watch the world end again and again, Kasimir the two headed winged stallion whose constancy has lasted millennia, the wolf who swallowed the sun, the pit fighter, the Technomancer, the bestiary of the enslaved--are haunting. The references to Norse mythology are ever-present, but oblique.And it's this obliqueness that's ultimately frustrating. Bear has a way of hinting at things without coming out and saying them, and in the end, I'm not completely sure I understand what happened. What happened to the World Serpent, whether the Technomancer ever understood fully what she was doing, how life will play out for the moreaux, what the ramifications of Muire's choice will ultimately be. I think she left us enough clues to piece it all together, and yet I'm still not sure how. So I loved reading this. I loved the language, I loved the complexity and shades-of-gray of all the characters, I loved the layered world-building. The ending works on an emotional level--it felt appropriately cathartic. But on a purely logical level, I'm still a little confused. I wish she'd given us a handful more paragraphs to spell things out for those of us who are apparently not quite as swift on the uptake as she wanted her readers to be."}, {"userName": "Clay Kallam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/961119-clay-kallam", "userReview": "Elizabeth Bear has become the Robert Silverberg of modern science fiction:A prolific author who suffers from that very strength, as too often herwork, like that of Silverberg, seems rushed, and begs for a little morepolish.\u201cAll the Windwracked Stars\u201d (Tor, $24.95, 368 pages) is one of her betterefforts, though, starting with the premise that \u201cworlds take a long timeto die,\u201d and that the final battle of the gods, when the Light went out ofhuman culture, was fought several thousand years ago.

They get on with their lives no matter what, and provide a measure of hope in the bleak word they inhabit. Norse legend, magic, strange technology and strong characters, I have high expectations of the other books in this series. If Bear keeps up the standard she sets in All the Windwracked Stars it could be a remarkable trilogy.

Rather than taking points off for the areas it didn't succeed, I went with my gut response and gave it all I had here.All The Windwracked Stars is ... very difficult to describe. Mythology, cyberpunk, urban fantasy, actual fantasy ... it's a great deal of things. And one of those things is challenging. This book does not hold your hand. It doesn't take time to explain things. Bear's approach to world-building is that this is a 102 class and if you didn't take the 101, that's not her problem. A working knowledge of all the major lore of Norse mythology is highly suggested, because this isn't just inspired by that canon -- it's set in that canon.Thinking of All the Windwracked Stars as a sequel to Norse mythology wouldn't be a bad idea. It's set in a universe where reincarnation is the thing, in every sense of the world. Nothing can come from nothing and all birth must come from death. This includes universes. The world of this novel sprang from the corpse of Midgard and is about to leave a corpse of its own. The valkyries have been torn asunder and have gone to war, and the result is a complete slaughter on both sides. Only three living beings walk away from this conflict: Muire, a deserter who fled the battlefield rather than die by her brothers and sisters, Mingan, the Grey Wolf who played both sides of the conflict and betrayed both, and Kasimir, the last stallion of the valyries. One of the casualties is the great Snake, the world serpent, who bears all the burdens of the world so that life can come forth despite it. Without the serpent to bear the burdens, life in this world will slowly die. Thousands of years pass, and humanity evolves in the death throes of the world. The story begins in earnest as the end has truly begun, with humanity having wiped itself out and only one city left in the world. It's a science fiction cyberpunk dystopian sort of place, where purity of blood is status, life is barely kept afloat by technomancy, and everyone is in denial that the world is about to end and mostly centers around the trio of Muire, Mingan, and Kasimir, along with a teenaged kickboxer and a cat-woman who both hold the keys to the chance for this world to keep on living.It is a very, very strange and wonderous world that doesn't really fit into any sort of niche. It's hard to give this book a genre classification because it's just so many things all at once. And the worldbuilding is absolutely not spoonfed to you. Bear doesn't take the time to explain the rules. You are expected to be 100% engaged and pick up what's needed on the fly. And it can be hard, because the book is told out of chronological order and has a vast mythos, half of which is not even covered in the book because it's just Norse myth, none of which Bear takes time to explain to you. The book moves at a breakneck pace and if you're not paying attention, you're going to be lost.Usually, this sort of thing bothers me, but I feel that All the Windwracked Stars earns its right to be this sort of roller coaster. It's challenging but it's fair, and it demands a big commitment from you in your engagement level but it never asks too much. One thing I loved about this book is that in spite of the short \"running time\" and breakneck pace, I really felt like there was enough time to get to know the characters in small, personal scenes that were good offbeats to the crazy train pace of the story. I usually find books paced in this way don't give me enough filler -- I like filler. Filler lets me get to know the characters and just hang out with them. But All the Windwracked Stars manages to let me feel like I'm getting downtime with the characters without needing to HAVE filler, and I really loved and respected that about it.The writing is absolutely beautiful, also. Bear has some serious chops. I'm very impressed at how she manages to combine artistic writing with a breakneck pace because that's something I personally stuggle with a lot as a writer. It's easy to be florid and flowy when you're not trying to move the plot, but Bear manages to do both very smoothly at the same time which is a big plus.I also just loved how unconventional and full of wonder this story is. The macho quest fantasy trappings that pollute the genre as runoff from the success of LoTR don't make any appearance here. It's all wonder and magic and fable and myth and it really feels as though anything were possible. I love this sort of story, where there's a real feeling of exploration and discovery and looking forward to what wonder you'll see next. Because the rules of magic are never quite laid out, it can continually surprise and delight you, and the big magic duel at the end was super enjoyable in part because we hadn't seen Muire let loose before that.It's impossible to be juggling this many plates without messing some things up though, and Bear does. The pace doesn't make quite as much time to bond with certain characters who the story demands empathy for -- mainly Astrid and Cristokos -- and that takes the bite out of some events. Astrid is especially bad, as she is a massively important character to Cathoair's life and story and arc and I never feel like we really get to sense what she's doing. I was a little confused at the love ... shape between all the characters -- no, really, like, all the characters -- and the ending seemed to be convinced that a decision was made and people paired off and shit, I didn't see any of that! And Mingan was defniitely my favourite character, but his arc was confused and he disappeared for too long a stretch in the middle for the fact that he's basically the deuragonist of this story.But there are times when ambition and scope and novelty just count for more than anything else, and this is one of them. This is not a perfect book, it has problems and it's very challenging to read and fully comprehend. But it's intensely unique and very emotionally weighted and I dare you not to care about these characters and be fascinated and compelled by this world.EDIT 25/07/13: I'm revising my rating down to four stars from the initial five, just because I don't feel this book stuck with me the way it would have needed to to deserve its five star rating. Comparing it to the other five stars I've read this year, it doesn't seem to belong on the same tier. I'm reading the sequel now and it's highlighting all the problems I had with the original and just generally being a way better book. I still love this book, I'm just bumping it down a little bit."}, {"userName": "Peter Goodman", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27654537-peter-goodman", "userReview": "\u201cAll the Windwracked Stars,\u201d by Elizabeth Bear (Tor, 2008). Steampunk meets fantasy. Hard SF and mythology. Magic and psychology. Sex and violence (and maybe even rock and roll). Muire is the last and least of the angels, the waelcyrge, badly met on the last battlefield with Kasimir the valraven. Their foe is the Grey Wolf; the world has come to an end, just as Midgard came to an end eons ago. The All Father was killed, too. In the harsh, frigid North. ----So, Norse mythology, including the World Serpent, the world tree, and so on. But there is also the last city, full of humans and unmans and moreaux (animals made into intelligent semi-humans), the last outpost of the highest science, led by the Technomancer, who has been secretly draining the rest of the living world of its souls to keep the city alive. The events take place over millennia in the world called Valdyrgard. Tremendously imaginative. One of the greatest feats, to my male mind, is the power of the kiss, to capture the soul of another, to leave traces of oneself in another. And the final duel between Muire and the Technomancer is musical: violin versus voice.
