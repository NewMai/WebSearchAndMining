However the ending was slightly disappointing for me. The book takes off where season three left it, and it grips your attention with lots of action and emotion, and really badass moments. The real journey starts when Riley is sent on another harrowing quest to get to the Birmingham Living Zone in a final desperate attempt to kickstart a cure to the zombie infection, 'Apocalypsis'.There is reunion between characters who have long been separated, revisiting of old places which gave me a bit of touching nostalgia, and the introduction of some intriguing and equally terrifying new enemies that you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of -- but of course, Riley and the group will do, as they always do. This season gave me everything I've come to expect from the Dead Days series, and a little more. I really like some of the new characters -- both the good and the very, very bad ones -- but the ending just didn't cut it for me. I thought it was just a bit too much too suddenly, and could have done with being written a little more gradually, slowly building up to it."}, {"userName": "Kelly Larrimore", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44795051-kelly-larrimore", "userReview": "Hope more are coming!!"}, {"userName": "Angela Verdenius", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11378467-angela-verdenius", "userReview": "Really enjoyed this, there were several things happening that I didn't expect or could even guess was going to happen.
