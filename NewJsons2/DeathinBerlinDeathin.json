That being said, I very much liked the change in setting. Kaye easily conjured up the sights, colors and smells of the allied occupied capital in the years following WWII. In her hands, the hopeful optimism of the city years before the rising of the Berlin Wall is wonderfully captured forever, and takes the reader on a tour of a place long vanished.The murder mystery is well plotted and features all the hallmarks of a Kaye novel: a fresh young heroine, an older, strong, stoic and silent hero, and the 6-8 typical \"stiff-upper-lip\" British secondary characters (all with means, motive and opportunity to do the deed).If you enjoy clean, cozy English murder mysteries similar in feel to Agatha Christie or Georgette Heyer, do yourself a favor and try one from M.M.

This one set in Berlin, Germany in 1953. Kaye did a very good job of describing the bombed out buildings, the piles of rubble that had already been grassed over into ski hills, bullet riddled statues and the different sectors. She was living there at the time so her descriptions have that ring of authenticity.There is a large cast of suspects and more than one mystery to be solved. I certainly didn't figure everything out. Miranda Brand joins some friends as they move to a new post in Berlin. She is going for a month long vacation. War-torn Berlin doesn't exactly sound like a great vacation spot to me but there is a connection to her past so that is probably why she was drawn there. The book starts with a very good prologue and then we are off on a train ride where things do go \"bump in the night.\" There is also a fortune in diamonds stolen by Nazis that was never recovered.

Ok, a 1.5 star rating is probably a little harsh, but I just did not enjoy this M.M. Kaye mystery! I wanted to, because I enjoyed her Death in the Andamans and Death in Kashmir: A Mystery very much. I tend to not be much of a fan of stories set against the backdrop of WW II, so that probably played a role in my distaste for this book. It's also possible that I almost hated this book because it took for-ev-er for this mystery to get going. I don't think things really started to pick up until about 100 pages in (and it's only a 254 page book)! I should say that I use the term \"pick up\" loosely here, because this story never did move much beyond a snail's pace, and it was harder than hell for me to get through! I was bored most of the time I was reading it!Furthermore, I just didn't connect with any of the characters in this story. There were too many of them to keep them all straight (it did not help that some of them were going by aliases), none of them were interesting, and there was absolutely no chemistry between the main character and the man who was supposed to be her love interest. In addition, I thought that the perpetrator of the crimes had a lame motive. Maybe in the 1950s it would have seemed more reasonable, but today it just seemed flimsy and weak. Also, the ending was just, I don't know, eye-roll inducing, almost on the scale of a Shakespearean romance play.So clearly there was not much about this story that I liked. I wanted to quit reading it several times. But I didn't. What M.M. Kaye did well was capture that sense of panic that we all feel welling up in us sometimes. Like when we're walking alone through a badly lit, somewhat desolate parking garage at night and we start to see murderers lurking in every shadow. Just as I'd about give the book up, Kaye would make me panic along with Miranda, and she'd hook me just enough to keep me reading.

I also was amused by the fact that the 9-year-old boy Wally and his friend 7-year-old Lottie actually knew all of the facts that would solve the case all along but no one bothered to ask them questions while all of the other 11 suspects were constantly being interrogated. Miranda is a young woman with an odd past.

The romance did move at break-neck speed-- jumping from a few significant looks and a soft gesture of affection to a proposal in the blink of an eye-- but at least Simon was likable. --Part of the reason I didn't love Miranda at first is probably the gratuitous physical comparisons between herself and the older Stella. Did these authors think that their audience was made up of only the very youngest women-- or did they think that a thirty- or forty-something lady would like reading such comparisons? Maybe I was just feeling particularly sensitive about my age when I read the first chapters...--Subsequent revelations explain most of it away, but Miranda's early reflections on Mademoiselle are so uncharitable that Miranda herself comes across as an unsympathetic character, for a while. --Ah, one of my pet peeves! \"'It's me,' said Miranda with a fine disregard for grammar.\" Mm-hmm, yes, dear.

How much of my reading is \"allowed\" to be escapist fluff before I'm relegated to the bubble-head class of woman? Book snobbery!! ;o)--It does seem a little bit of a stretch that Stella would be so willing to kill Miranda-- and it's always hard to believe when a character has seemed mostly normal and been able to hide their insanity and/or wickedness successfully for so many years. However, it seems a necessary evil for this type of book. There's not much of a mystery if characters behave normally or aren't good at hiding their true nature.--I'm seeing another trend in the \"Death in...\" books I've read so far...

Kaye is the second book of the Death in... mystery series, set in Berlin in 1953 (when the author lived there). Steeped in authentic period atmosphere of the years between WWII and before the Berlin Wall was constructed. For a holiday trip, Miranda Brand travels by train to Berlin with a group of military families who work for the British or American sectors. She learns at dinner one night on the train of a famous unsolved jewel theft, a treasure hidden in a doll. A murder occurs on the train, and Miranda discovers the body. Rather than spending a carefree holiday in Berlin, Miranda spends her days tracking down clues, learning relationships and past history of the small group of train travelers. As she investigates, she trusts only in Simon, a secretive man, who may be in law enforcement or an espionage agency, and on whom she develops a crush. As in an Agatha Christie cozy mystery, all the suspects are in the group who traveled on the train together, and the solution lies in secrets from their past.

Young Miranda Brand accompanies her cousin (who is in the British service) and other British families to their station in Germany. After a dinnertime story told by a brigadier - one that shockingly ties into Miranda's past - the mood becomes one of tension, suspicion...and ultimately murder. M.M. Kaye does play fairly with the reader, although she cleverly disguises the truth by tossing in a handful of red herrings (many of which are explained away at the end of the book). The back cover of my edition compliments her by stating she is good at \"palming the Ace\", and I agree with that.

Kaye is one of those novels that is quite difficult to read and rate impartially. At least for me it was. An ordinary person may have problems enough with it, but may be able to get past the faults. Someone who has been steeped in military culture, as I have, has a hard time with some of the less than admirable aspects of the worldview expounded upon in the work. For this reason, I am torn somewhat. I have been told by some before that it is necessary to rate a work impartially based on just the nature of the quality of writing therein. My habit of judging based on what I perceive to be pernicious cultural, moral, religious, or philosophical elements is not approved of by many. I make no qualms about doing so though. I feel that if the viewpoint is incidental to the work, it is one thing. When it infuses the work, to the extent that the \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d characters are divided by way of said viewpoint, then the author is now pushing a philosophy (whether consciously or not) and criticism of said philosophy is fair game. I will endeavor to not give away too much of the plot or details. In the book, there are a series of murders surrounding a group of British military families travelling by train from their homes in England to the husbands\u2019 new assignment in the British and American sectors of Berlin post-World War II. Traveling with them is a young woman who is a minor fashion model named Miranda Brand. She is both the narrator and the key to the entire plot, though she doesn\u2019t yet realize her part in the whole sordid tale. Indeed, she will not recognize it until late in the book, near the denouement. The prose is fairly casual, but that is in no way a criticism of it. Indeed, it is high praise. The author attempts to recount what life was like to an audience that is geographically and culturally far removed from the novel\u2019s setting. That she can be quite in-depth, and yet still manage to sound casual, and not like a textbook is fairly remarkable. Some of the best writers do sound like droning geography or history textbooks. Two of my favorite books are Daniel Defoe\u2019s *Robinson Crusoe* and Jules Verne\u2019s *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea*, yet I must admit that the level of details in each is aggravating to the point of wanting to throw the book away in disgust during some of the more descriptive parts. VERY descriptive parts, at that. The only other authors that have managed to write in agonizing detail, yet NOT be incredibly annoying whilst doing so are J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. M. M. Kaye joins this very august company of uniquely talented writers, at least in this one facet. The mystery was well-laid out, though I knew early on who the murderer was. This truly disappointed me because I really did like this character a lot. The predictability of the story was a bother to me. So was the fact that the long-winded explanation really didn\u2019t work for me. All of the set-up for a really short action sequence, and a really long final scene that was obviously for the purpose of exposition to explain everything to the reader, fell flat. Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie might do this well in their books, but not Kaye here. Despite these objections, I truly did enjoy the book. It was a fun trip to the days of post-war Germany, when the world was just starting to grow into the bipolar world it would be for several decades, and life was different, if not a bit scarier and simpler at the same time. The criticisms of the faults of the book are common to all mystery fiction, and though Kaye is not as good as the masters of the genre, she is, in fact, better than most. I would normally rate a book like this quite highly, but in this case, I cannot. This brings us to the crux of the matter: the pernicious ideas because of which I cannot simply happily rate the novel highly. One of them is not major, and indeed, even if it were, I could still ignore it. It is the contempt for the enlisted personnel. They are not even mentioned, or their families, unless it is to dismiss them. Now, I have not read her other books, so I might be reading too much into this, or maybe it is my own sensitivity to the subject. I was enlisted, and most of the officers I knew viewed themselves as better than the enlisted man or woman, just because of the rank they had due to their holding of a bachelor degree, even though many enlisted also have degrees. They also viewed themselves as the important ones in the Army, even though they never dig trenches, and for maybe six months maximum are in harm\u2019s way during deployments. They view their air-conditioned office work as the most critical part of the war effort. Not all of them, mind you, but most officers. But, as I said, this is typical of fiction. People really are not concerned with the enlisted ranks in their fiction, so I can ignore this fault just as I can ignore the cursing and bawdy humor in other works of fiction. What I cannot ignore is the one part of the military culture that I would honestly call not just negative, but plain evil itself. This is the lax view of marriage, and the attendant almost cult-like insistence that spouses accept military cultures and ideas, *or else*. Let me explain this. I do not want to give too much away about the plot, but just to say that the murderer is already to blame for the death of another man. Her previous husband. Why? Well, because she would not go along with military culture. She wanted to \u201chave her cake and eat it too\u201d to quote one character\u2019s snide remark about her. The back story of her refusal to go along with her husband\u2019s move to a foreign duty station is not just something to fight about, but a deep fault on her behalf. In fact, we are shown that there is unanimous agreement that she deserved to be divorced and cheated on because of her refusal to want to move. It seems that her husband\u2019s death in a dangerous assignment after her refusal to divorce him, and the suicide of the marriage wrecker that he was going to leave her for, is ultimately blamed on her. She is guilty as surely as if she had murdered them personally. At least, this is the view of the characters in the book. The idea that she is the murderess, and is indeed evil and vile, is apparent from her refusal to accept military culture. In military culture, it is understood that when someone marries a member of the military, they marry the whole unit, branch of service and military itself. The needs of the military are dominant. If someone will not accept the pressures of military life, and is angry about it, then they deserve to be left. They have committed the ultimate sin, refusing to submit to the whims of the military. Indeed, she is not really grieving for her first husband, but was faking it. She was vile enough to do so, villain that she was for not \u201ccutting it\u201d. When I was in the Army, especially during and directly after deployment, I saw many marriages dissolve. The wives or husbands left behind would either cheat, or, if they did not, the deployed soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, would become angry at the lack of understanding of their spouses back home. I sympathized with them, but some of them I had to turn away from in horror. They were going beyond anger to outright cheating, withholding monies as much as legally possible, or in other ways acting cruel to their husbands or wives back home. Why? Simple, to punish the (you supply the horrific curse words) for not understanding. They would talk of how they were under pressure, so the husband or wife back home deserves it. I had to tell them at such times that they were completely wrong. The issue where this ties into the narrative in the book is that the killer (and I have still left a lot unsaid, as readers will see) was portrayed as xenophobic, and I believe that that was Kaye\u2019s intention on the motive. Xenophobia, combined with an insane jealousy. However, the bias in favor of this evil part of military culture is so prevalent that it seeps into the story, and we are left with the idea that even apart from murder, the killer is still evil and worse than an absolute slut, a thief who had committed many more murders, or really any other characters. In this narrative, Kaye\u2019s absolute contempt for anyone who couldn\u2019t *cut it* is apparent, as is her view of them as a villain of sorts. In the end, I found myself in enormous pity of the woman, despite her crimes, because I cannot find myself capable of hating her for not accepting military culture, anymore than I could find myself able to hate the real-world spouses of my guys and gals in my unit when they would get cheated on, or kept financially poor, or otherwise \u201cpunished\u201d for their sins. I can accept the narrative that the killer is an evil murderess, but not that it is obvious that she is because of the vileness of her character for not accepting military life with a cheerful smile. I know that some might wonder at my spending so much time on this. I do so because I cannot allow this area of military life to go uncondemned, or misunderstood. My friends who know me know that I am deeply admiring of, and proud of my military background. I will defend the military to my dying breath, because I believe that the military sacrifices for our freedoms, and is the best of any of us. This is not a hit on the military, but an honest portrayal of the only part that is bad, in my opinion. Seeing military members\u2019 marriages dissolve makes me sensitive to this evil. The rest of the military way of life is far superior to civilian life, in my opinion. This actually leads to a fault in the narrative. Though there is ample evidence of guilt, much of the initial suspicion rests on the character of the murderess being vile, and her vile character is founded upon her unwillingness to accept military culture, and thus being \u201cevil\u201d for not doing so. This is not just a problem because I do not personally agree, but because it is dependent upon a cultural attitude that few people could possibly understand or agree with. There is no way for many non-military readers not to scratch their heads at the military cultural logic that Kaye uses. Logic in a story must make sense to a reader even if they do not agree, not be illogical as well as reprehensible. I enjoyed the book in general, and from what I have seen of her other works from my leafing through them, I am sure that I will enjoy them a great deal. I cannot get past the problems in this one though. I will say that it is a superbly written book, yet I am not able to recommend it for the above faults that I have noted. I am fairly certain that not all of Kaye\u2019s books have this same worldview so prominent to the point of being preached to the reader. I am looking forward to them, but this one disappointed me. Definitely not recommended."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28255179-susan", "userReview": "Very good mystery, set in early 1950\u2019s Berlin.

While travelling, they and several other passengers are regailed at dinner one night by the long, drawn-out tale of a retired brigadier, something about missing jewels and the disappearance of a Nazi and his wife. When the brigadier is found murdered in his train compartment, the entire group falls under suspicion, and Miranda finds herself playing detective and falling in love with the real detective investigating the case. COMMENTS: Kaye's brand of romantic suspense is always an escapist-type pleasure to read."}, {"userName": "Tara Carpenter", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1096108-tara-carpenter", "userReview": "I'd give this 3.5 stars.I finally got to the last book in this collection. There are 5 or 6, all stand-alone, but all with the same basic plot. Young girl, traveling with friends or distant family, gets embroiled in some kind of murder plot. Handsome stranger/policeman/knight-in-shining-armor helps out - but is he really what he seems??? Luckily I'm a fan of this type and I always enjoyed the exotic settings. This one was much less so, post-war Germany. I recommend one of the others over this for setting. But Kaye is also really good at atmosphere and scary moments."}, {"userName": "Katerina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23157806-katerina", "userReview": "An interesting writing. I liked the atmosphere of the divided Berlin just at the end of the war. I enjoyed the small details of the life of that time, the train journeys, the movings to new houses and the raising of children. The murder story was consistently build up without making it totally clear who the murderer is. Interesting also the old story of Herr and Frau Ridder, around which the murders are turning. Easily read and enjoyable. It was the first book of this writer that I read and I will get my hands on more."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120029-michelle", "userReview": "M.M. Kaye is known for the details of the exotic locations she writes about as her \"Death in\" mysteries are usually set in places she lived or visited when the British were still a strong presence. It can be difficult not to view her heroines through a modern lens and become eye-rolley over their actions from time to time, but for the most part these books are enjoyable and a fun glimpse at an era I will never experience. Death in Berlin is not one of my favorites. The mystery is a bit more sluggish. The post war Berlin backdrop is dreary, and the heroine is bland."}], "description": "Miranda Brand is visiting Germany for what is supposed to be a month's vacation. But from the moment that Brigadier Brindley relates the story about a fortune in lost diamonds--a story in which Miranda herself figures in an unusual way--the vacation atmosphere becomes transformed into something more ominous. And when murder strikes on the night train to Berlin, Miranda finds herself unwillingly involved in a complex chain of events that will soon throw her own life into peril. Set against a background of war-scarred Berlin in the early 1950s, M. M. Kaye's Death in Berlin is a consummate mystery from one of the finest storytellers of our time.", "title": "Death in Berlin\n      \n          (Death in... #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10221.Death_in_Berlin", "average": 3.88, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312017518l/10221.jpg", "reviews": 68, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1040250.M_M_Kaye", "name": "M.M.
