I absolutely LOVE being able to do other things while I listen to a book! I listen when I'm doing the housework, driving my car, folding the washing... Even have it on speaker when I'm in the shower! Feels like I am accomplishing something when I am doing menial tasks! Love it! And I LOVED this Tami Hoag thriller! This is the first book I have ever \"read\" of Hoag's, but it absolutely wont be the last!The year is 1985 and while running through the woods, children find the body of a woman buried in the ground. Her eyes had been glued together, the ear drums destroyed and the mouth glued shut. It is soon apparent that they have a serial killer on their hands in the town of Oak Knoll, as two other bodies have been found this way in the last two years. Investigator Mendez calls out FBI agent Vince Leone t0 help with the case. Vince is an expert at the controversial new skill called \"profiling\" (controversial back in 1985 that is...), and he uses his talents to find the killer. The story also delves into the lives of the children who found the body, and mainly focuses on their teacher Anne Navarre, who finds herself at risk of becoming the next victim.Deeper Than The Dead was a great story! Although I was a bit disappointed with the ending and the \"twist\" that was not really a twist at all, I was still thoroughly entertained by this wonderful book.The audio version worried me at first, as Kirsten Potters American accent is quite heavy, and I cringed at having to listen to it for 10 hours. However she did a really great job at the narration. I enjoyed her performance and after a little while the accent didn't distract me at all. I especially enjoyed her portrayal of Chicago's Vince.The characters were all really detailed and enjoyable. The children were written really well , I really enjoyed how all the characters interacted and intertwined within the story. Loved the 1985 setting. I can barely remember when mobile phones weren't the norm, and fingerprinting was done by a fingerprinting expert and not a computer system. Really makes you thankful for the technology that we take for granted today. DNA evidence was unheard of, and even police reports had to be sent or faxed over. No email here folks!Loved the romance, even though it was EXTREMELY corny. I want to marry you after knowing you for 3 days and going through an extremely traumatic ordeal... Yeah right... But still, I found myself getting swept up in it. I love a bit of romance with my thrillers!My favourite character was Vince by far! Fabulous! Bullet in the head Vince. I hope he is in the future novels set in Oak Knoll, yes this is the first in a series apparently.Would I recommend it?Absolutely! Thought it was a great read! Looking forward to future ones, hope the audio versions are done with the same narrator!For more reviews visit my blogwww.booksbabiesbeing.comFind me on twitterwww.twitter.com/BBB_Mel"}, {"userName": "Once Upon a Twilight", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3515991-once-upon-a-twilight", "userReview": "The book took off from the very beginning. Every chapter was filled with suspense and drama and honestly, I couldn't put the book down. I especially loved how Tami Hoag described the characters and their surroundings with such detail. I actually felt like I was living in Oak Knoll! The book had me guessing who the serial killer was the whole time and just when I thought it was this person, new things happen and made me change my mind completely.

I then gave it even more time and it did move ok for a bit. But it's asking too much of me. I just can not suspend disbelief enough to finish this. 1. A gay male kindergarten teacher. What more can I say? It's about as believable as a unicorn. He lives alone with his two dogs and he's the heroine's BFF. He literally referred to himself as her \"sidekick\". Argh! He comes across to me as the stereotypical gay man who wants to be a straight woman. Pro tip: Gay men do not want to be straight women. Every time he shows up it's like nails on a chalk board.2. The book is too conscientiously set in 1985. Again and again the year is mentioned. If I wasn't able to retain major plot points I'd be watching tv not reading.3. The cops are psychic! They know that \"In The Future\" we will have computers and fax machines and national data bases that will make our jobs so much easier. That's about it, I've read just shy of half the book and I'm done. Oh the killer!

Her eyes and mouth have been glued shut and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s been tortured. As the children\u2019s teacher, Anne Navarre, tries to get them the help they need to process this horror, the local police turn to an FBI investigator, Vince Leone, to help develop a profile of the killer.Hoag writes a tight, suspenseful tale. The action is fast-paced, and I was completely captivated from beginning to end. I liked the characters, especially Anne and Vince. This is the first book by Hoag that I\u2019ve read; it won\u2019t be the last. Kirsten Potter does a fine job performing the audio book. She has good pacing, and enough skill as a voice artist to give each character a unique voice. I particularly liked the way she voiced Anne and Vince."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie", "userReview": "I have read Ms Hoag, but it has been quite a while back so I was happy to revisit her. This was OK for me. A good suspenseful who done it with so much going on that the reader was led from one suspect to another before the big reveal. A good job throwing out those breadcrumbs. I appreciated that the author comments in the notes that she knew she wanted to tell a story set in the time of Dallas, shoulder pads, big hair and Miami Vice as this was her growing up time (as well as mine) What I thought was interesting was that she had to get rid of all the \"high tech\" that is in our world today. No cell phones, no computer or google searching, no FBI data base, fingerprints being matched visually! We have come a long way.  That said. I felt the \"detectives\" fell a bit flat, especially the hot shot profiler from Chicago. Perhaps he was not being fed all the same tidbits that the reader was! It took an awfully long time to get to the rather drawn out ending. I was also a bit amazed that in this small, idyllic town there were SO many dysfunctional people. And I mean a lot!! Goes to show you that we never know what goes on behind closed doors. Entertaining? Yes. Edge of my seat? Not really."}, {"userName": "Obsidian", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian", "userReview": "If I had read this book first in the series, I would have never read books #2 and #3. Everyone (except for three out of the four kids) was terrible. Every adult was the worst ever. I felt like there were just too many characters for you to really focus on. I think if Hoag had either stuck with the lead detective to tell her story, or switched between him and the FBI profiler, it would have worked better. Instead we had at least 10 or more POVs I think. And we had the serial killer plot-line, the sociopath kid plot-line, the teacher and FBI agent falling in love, the detective trying to run his case, the one kid dealing with his terrible mother and absent father, another kid dealing with her parents, etc. Nothing hung together very well IMHO.I can't tell you much about the characters besides what I said above. I liked the characters of Wendy and Tommy the best. Everyone else was awful.The writing was not typical Hoag either. I feel like she was mimicking 1980s thriller/books back in the day which is the only way I can try to grasp why there was a lot of misogyny in this book. I just felt turned off by the two male leads, such as they were for this book.The flow was pretty bad though. I think the main reason was that we had so many POVs and you found yourself (or excuse me, I found myself) getting impatient to get to who the serial killer was and the rest of the book felt like background noise. I get why Haog did it though, she follows up on two plot lines from this book (Wendy and her parents along with the pre-teen boy who is a bully and abusive) in book #2. I will say that though the setting is the 1980s and Hoag makes a big deal about not relying on DNA evidence, this book was pretty weak. We don't get to see how not having DNA hampers the case at all. The town brings in the FBI to profile the serial killer. He is able to put together a pretty good profile of the killer. I really did want to see more issues like the Kinsey Milhone series does with her having to go and read microfiche, she had to go and interview a ton of suspects, her having to do a lot of nitty gritty work. This whole book was the cops going around and acting like jackasses for the most part to suspects, suspects wives and to kids at some points in the book.The ending was a miss for me. I don't know what big takeway I was supposed to get, but unless Hoag has another book in the series I don't see what the payoff would be."}, {"userName": "\u262eKaren", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen", "userReview": "I listened to the audiobook. There was a lot going on all at once and all of a sudden here in small-town California: multiple murder suspects for multiple murders, families in discord and chaos (no wedded bliss here), children stumbling over dead people, one of the children is a sociopath, and even the police are not exempt from investigation.One of those called in to investigate is an FBI agent from Chicago, but from his accent you would think him from New Jersey or New York. I bet the narrator has seen Chicago's police chief Garry McCarthy (he hails from NJ and NY) on the news, who happens to be the one and only person in Chicago who talks like that! First rule of narrating: If you're doing an accent, please get it right. When I can guess the killer right off the bat, as I did here, it always gives me mixed feelings about the book. Either the writing was lacking or I am a genius. I usually have to go with the former, and for that reason 2 stars."}, {"userName": "Jess Schira", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3906473-jess-schira", "userReview": "If you are looking for a romance novel with hot guys Deeper Than the Dead is not the book for you. However, if you want a novel that is going to keep you up late and worry about what your neighbors are up to, you are going to love this novel. Deeper Than the Dead has all the ingredients a good thriller needs including crooked cops, creepy kids, grisly murders, and bizarre burials.One of Hoag\u2019s trademarks is her writing voice; it is consistent and smooth. That alone would be enough to have her standing out from the mass amount of authors who are currently penning books. Hoag is able to use this voice to create complex settings and interesting characters. I was very impressed with Hoag\u2019s ability to leap from one character POV to another. Usually the character hopping gives me a hopping, but Hoag was able to pull it off in a way that was very easy to follow. More importantly, by leaping POV\u2019s Hoag was able to make me feel sympathetic towards the characters, even the ones who are clearly evil. All of her characters were well developed and stayed very consistent to themselves throughout the entire novel.As soon as you open the book you are launched directly into the middle of a torture scene. Mixed into the victims thoughts are flashes of a letter that has clearly been written by a child, glorifying their father. The next scene is set in a fifth grade classroom and ends with the discovery of a decomposing body. The scene is important because it introduces you to many of the main characters in a way that is both interesting and believable.Deeper Than the Dead reads very quickly, which is a good thing because once you start to read it, you will find that putting it down is very nearly impossible."}, {"userName": "Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun", "userReview": "I enjoyed this, though it is the least favorite of her novels that I've read so far.On the positive side, Tami Hoag knows serial killers. She has clearly read her share of true life crime and FBI profiling books. I've read them to.I like that she explores the why in her fictional accounts. I think most true crime books explore the how, when, where and what but few give us a good sense of the why. That's where her time spent reading John Douglas and Roy Hazelwood shows.She's also a good writer. The pacing is good and the multiple plots all come full circle. On the negative side, I thought too many of Hoag's characters relied on tired stereotypes. And while I expect and even forgive unlikely coincidences, she seemed to push the envelope here.Overall, an entertaining read. A little formulaic but hey, that's expected, and despite the cookie cutter approach, I think she brings some interesting insights to the table.Bottom line: Should appeal to her fans and/or fans of this genre."}, {"userName": "Jane Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart", "userReview": "Absorbing mystery. Scary suspense. But unfinished ending.Well done story telling. Good character development. I liked interactions and conversations. The last hour was edge of your seat. There is an enjoyable romance, but it\u2019s a minor part of the story. Anne\u2019s friend Franny was very entertaining.CAUTION FOR SENSITIVE READERS:Violence and torture. The serial killer glues the eyes and mouth shut, destroys the ear drums, and tortures with a knife. There was not a lot of detail, but those ideas stayed with me more than I wanted. One expert said \u201cThe strength of your villain is the strength of your story.\u201d Well this villain was very bad. It\u2019s good to have bad villains. I don\u2019t want to fault the author over this, but this one depressed me more than others.Several children suffered, but I hurt the most for two of them - permanent damage by their parents. A significant part of the story was showing troubled marriages with different problems. One was a physically abusive father. Another was a narcissistic mother. I shudder at things done by both of them.PROBLEMS:I was happy toward the end with what happened to the killer. But I was angry with the author in the last few pages. She introduced a second bad person holding evidence from the victims and did not explain it. I had no idea how this person was connected to the crimes. It was an open ending. The book was not finished. I don\u2019t know why authors do this. It makes me frustrated and angry. According to other reviewers these questions were not answered in the sequel.A couple things were missing that I wanted to know. How did the killer get glue in the eyes without the victim seeing him before he did it? Where did he keep the victims?THE NARRATOR:The narrator was good except for her voice for Vince who was a former Chicago cop. The narrator used an east coast accent for him, part Boston, part Brooklyn. It was nothing like Chicago. One example of a Chicago accent is Dennis Farina, a Chicago cop turned actor.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person. Unabridged audiobook length: 13 hrs and 43 mins. Swearing language: strong including religious swear words, but not often used. Sexual language: none. One brief sex scene. Setting: 1985 California. Book copyright: 2010.

I also kept expecting the 1980s to somehow tie into the present day, even in an epilogue, which made the whole time setting kind of pointless to me. I also was a little offended by the sole gay character who was so flaming he needed a fire extinguisher. Aren't we past this kind of homo uncle tomming? But overall, in spite of the above, it was a good read and held my interest until the very last page, so in the end I would definitely say the book's good points outweighed its negatives and would recommend it to those of you who enjoy suspense/crime fiction."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64405673-beth", "userReview": "This was my first Tami Hoag book and I must say, I'm a fan. I got sucked in right away and read thru the entire night until I figured out \"who done it\". I think the best part about this book in particular was the fact that it was set in the past. A lot of crime series rely on modern day technology to help their protagonist solve the mystery at hand. This book takes place in 1985 before computers, criminal databases and even technology to analyze fingerprints existed. This book reminds me a bit of flashbacks from the show Criminal Minds. I appreciate the detailed profiling and the authors ability to keep the secret of who the monster was until the very end. Hoag throughout this novel reveals the families of 3 children all of which have a member who could be the killer. As an avid reader there is nothing I hate more than figuring out the answers too early. This book however provides so many perfect candidates you cant help but read on as you switch from person to person. As the story draws to a close I find there is still so much more I want to know about the family of the killer.. I must say.. I was left wanting."}, {"userName": "L. Chambers-Wright", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210312-l-chambers-wright", "userReview": "I give the novel two stars because I haven't found a typo. Unfortunately, that is the best trait of the work. I have read several of Ms. Hoag's novels, as I'm an avid reader, and I try to give authors a few tries, especially if they have a sizable following. Sadly, all of her books seem to share some similar traits that just annoy me right out of the story. I try to be constructive with reviewing, so I'll explain my rating.This novel is set in 1985. That's fine, but there are repeated references to the point where you just want to say, \"I get it, it's 1985.\" The repeated head jumping has forced me to stop several times, just to make sure I know which character the author is speaking or thinking from. There are numerous instances of problems with showing vs. telling. We aren't given examples of how characters do what they do, we're simply told they are this way, because the author says so. The author also makes repeated allusions of approaching technology or procedure from the future, but the story is supposed to be in 1985. There is also a good deal of parenthetical material, in the first chapters, which do not belong in parenthesis. They should've been given their own sentences. The characters tend to come across as stereotypical portrayals, sometimes to the point of caricatures. This is something that has occurred in the other novels by the author. Likewise, characters are oddly moody or emotional towards one another. The dialogue is often clunky and clich\u00e9d. This book features the schoolmarm, the flamboyant stereotype of a gay man, the wife-beater, the redneck, and several others. Her best friend is flamboyantly gay so he makes a scene wherever he goes. The main character in this novel, Anne, is the conventional old schoolmarm who never married. She's moody and often hateful, but she still isn't explained well enough to grant her real depth. The perspective of the kids is fairly well done, but you still get a sense that an adult is trying to depict what a kid is thinking. The main character describes herself as \"conservative as they come,\" yet this schoolmarm abandons her inhibitions to have sex with a man she's known a day and a half. As if that wasn't unbelievable enough for the character, they're outside on the back porch, with her father at home. She lives with her father. They're out in the open while there's enough light to discern what color the wine is. Any neighbor or passer-by can stop to watch, and several do.The book has numerous instances of child abuse that no one cares about, even the teachers. We are given a child bully, and an adult bully, but no reason is ever given as to why they bully. One of the children in the novel is caught trying to force another child to eat a dead human finger, while a serial killer is on the loose, but the authorities don't really seem to care. It is implied the child is a deranged psychopath, but we aren't told why or how he became that way. There's a pedophile mentioned in the book, one of the suspects, and he is the epitome of the stereotypical hillbilly. Human remains are found in the \"hogpen,\" but oddly enough, any information on that wasn't important enough to include elsewhere. An autopsy is performed, but it is described as if the corner is wearing a spacesuit. These discrepancies in detail leave much to be desired from the readers' perspective. The most interesting characters are the ones least discussed. I am a fan of horror and supernatural novels, so long as the gruesome scenes justify the story. There are just too many loose ends, too much chaos, and too many questions left unanswered."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9134488-carol", "userReview": "Reading the Reviews was almost as entertaining as the book itself.... certainly produced a variety of opinions! My opinion, worthless to anyone other than myself, is: Hoag is one of the better female thriller authors. Sure, she gets a bit boggled down here and there with predictable actions/scenes... but overall, she does deliver some interesting twists along the way. What I appreciated most were the revelations that people/families cannot be judged by their public personas... something I've found to be true in real life. To believe we live with perfect family members and acquaintances smacks of denial; meanness and evil exists, in many forms and degrees.

Argh!! *tearing my hairs* Oh, and the gay best friend is a portrait of a stereotyped gay man *sigh*. Sure, stereotypes exist for a reason; but I guess I wasn't amused with his characterization here.

Discovering the woman\u2019s body is only the beginning of how they become entangled in this mystery in a small town.ThoughtsThis was my first Tami Hoag book; I\u2019ve been seeing her books everywhere for years and have been meaning to get around to it. My coworker actually brought me her copy from home and let me borrow it so it gave me the extra shove I needed to finally get on it.One thing to note about \u2018Deeper than the Dead\u2019 is that it\u2019s set in 1985. I must have glanced over these previous information, if it had been mentioned earlier, but not until I read a part where they were talking about an individual having a car phone and calling it an extravagant toy. \u201dBut I doubt he and his cronies are playing cards in his car, and why would he lug that phone into his card game with him? You have to carry the damn things around in a suitcase.\u201dI need to get me one of those.What I found most interesting about this murder mystery is the fact that there were three very prominent suspects that were regular members of society. I find that typical serial killer novels I\u2019ve read are always lurking in the background and aren\u2019t out standing in the spot light. I first liked that there were SO many suspects so that it wasn\u2019t quite so obvious, but as the story progressed not only did I know exactly who it was but the intense focus that was placed on the other \u2018suspects\u2019 made it seem cheesy and a bit annoying after a while. I\u2019m big on the murder mysteries but this one definitely wasn\u2019t my favorite.

I have had it in my bookcase for almost 12 months and wish I read it earlier! It's the first in the Oak Knoll series, and I actually read the 2nd some time back and didn't realize it was a series, so they are able to be read as stand alone. But after reading this one, I will revisit the 2nd, and read on! Anne Navarre is a school teacher of 10 year olds. She loves teaching, and loves her kids, though some are harder to love than others! One afternoon, as two friends, Tommy and Wendy, were walking home from school, through the nearby woods, Tommy fell down a slight gully and landed on the body of a young woman. She was buried except for her head, which was above the ground, and as pale as alabaster. Dennis and Cody appeared almost instantly, and while Cody screamed and ran for his life, Dennis was fascinated with the body, poking at it! In horror, Wendy told him not to, but when had Dennis ever taken notice of them. He was a bully, they tended to keep away from him when they could. Along with the police, their teacher Anne suddenly appeared, and she was as shaken as they were. Tommy and Wendy had to remain on the scene to talk to the detectives, until finally they were able to leave, Anne running them home, and all of them knowing their lives would never be the same again.Vince Leone, FBI investigator from Virginia, is called in to try to get into the mind of the killer, and to work alongside Detective Tony Mendez and the sheriff's office. It seems there are many secrets in the small town of Oak Knoll, and the residents who all seemed to have wonderful, happy lives find those lives beginning to shatter! The children are terrified, and the community is devastated when more women are found, tortured horribly. When will it end? The continuing twists, the suspense and unspeakable horror of what is happening will leave you glued to the pages until the end.Tami Hoag writes thrillers alongside the likes of Lisa Gardner and Tess Gerritsen.

About mid book we determine that there might be a second killer working in the area as bones are found in a hog pen. However, by the end of the book these murder(s) are abruptly dropped.2. We never truly know why the murderer actually kills his victims or what his wife's background is though it is implied that her back story might be an interesting one.Since our hero is a profiler I felt there should have been more explanation as to why this killer did what he did.3. The chief deputy is so awful I ha difficulty believing he would ever have been hired much less maintained keeping his job.4.

This was her first book after a little without a new one. I purchased it right after it was released, but then I kept picking others in front of it because I wanted to save it. I really really loved it. It kept me guessing all the way until the end. Each chapter left you with a new revelation. I couldn't put it down.

The only thing, though, was the numerous characters. The book has a lot of names that I needed to go back and forth to remember. And I felt like it fell short on how the other issues were solved.

The body is only partially buried, with her eyes and her mouth sealed shut by superglue. Dennis's dad, Frank Farman, is part of the team of deputies who come in to investigate. In the meantime, the kids' teacher, Anne Navarre, has followed them into the woods and is trying to run some sort of damage control for the kids, at least.Detective Tony Mendez, the new kid and only Hispanic on the force, realizes there is a good possibility this is a serial murder. There have been two bodies found in a similar way prior to this, just not both in their jurisdiction. While Farman ridicules him, Dixon, the chief of police, okays Mendez to get in touch with the FBI and their forensic profiler team, which brings us to Vince Leone.Vince is actually supposed to be on medical leave but he's met Tony before and thinks Tony might be right in his assumptions. He agrees to come out to California to help work the case, much to Farman's disgust at the 'newfangled' procedures. Vince has his own problems, though - he was shot a year ago and still carries a 22 slug around in his brain. Divorced, father of two girls he doesn't see any more Vince has the FBI as his life and family but realizes he wants something different.The story revolves around the Crane, Morgan and Farman families, each one dysfunctional in its own way. Tommy's mother, Janet, is a shrew and his father, Peter, the town dentist, hides out from her. Wendy's parents, Steve and Sara, are on the verge of a separation. Frank is physically and emotionally abusive to his family, beating his wife, Sharon, and Dennis as well. Their interactions with Vince and Anne, who also become involved with each other, twist and tangle the storyline until it is a Gordian knot of possibilities. The problem is - the killer already has his next victim in hand, a woman named Karly, who was supposed to start work at Steve's law firm and was last seen at Dr. Crane's office.This was a page-turner. The characters all seem to be very well thought out and, even though none of them seem particularly happy with their lives, some of them are very engaging. Anne, particularly, strikes a few chords, as does her best friend, Franny, the gay kindergarten teacher.Very engaging and a gripping story, I'd be happy to recommend it to anyone who likes a creepy mystery."}, {"userName": "Keri", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2335749-keri", "userReview": "The year was 1985. Duran, Duran was on the radio, Queen's Radio GaGa was on video and dead bodies are half buried in the park. At least that is what four 5th graders discovered as they were racing through the park. To bad young sensitive Danny is the one that fell right on top of the victim. As Anne Navarre, their teacher, tries to help her students cope with the horror that they have uncovered. Law enforcement have to cope with the fact that this is not their first victim, this is their third. As the town starts to grapple with whom in their midst is a killer, the killer carries on his secret life, for his next victim is already in his hands. He could be anybody, the lawyer who helped fill out your will, the dentist that fixed your cavity or even the guy who bags your groceries. Sheriff Dixon knows he is in over his head and decides to call in the FBI. Enter Vince Leone, a tall good looking dark Italian with a wise cracking mouth and a Tom Selleck mustache. All the better to keep you from staring at the scar that leads to the bullet still lodged in his brain. Profiling is in its infancy, AFIS is not online yet and the only DNA crime database is still buried deep in some nerd's head waiting to be born. So Vince uses his knowledge of talking to many serial killer's over the years and getting in their heads. He is a man who never quits until he gets his man. Meanwhile the kid's horror continues as the ripples of what they uncovered start to affect not only them but everybody around them as well. Anne does the best she can to protect her kids. Even if she has to stand up to Vince herself. Only once Vince gets sight of Anne he wants to do more than interrogate her. (Thank you Ms. Hoag for paying homage to your writing past as you include a bit of serious romance for those that miss your work so very much in that genre.)As Vince and the rest of Oak Knoll's Law Enforcement struggle to find another missing young woman, the little Peyton Place of lies starts to unravel and perfect families facades start to crumble. Who will be left in the rubble? Broken homes, broken dreams and of course broken children. Oak Knoll, CA Pop. Small Town; Serial Killers Pop 1...for now. If you have never read Tami Hoag I urge you to give this book a try. Vince is her new character and a serious contender for my heart. I can't wait to read the next one in the series, Secrets from the Grave. (Warning: There is graphic descriptions of the bodies in question and deeds of past serial killers.)

That said, I found this book laughably bad. I have given it 2 stars because I reserve 1 star ratings for books I can't finish after a year or more. I managed to finish this one, but was sorry I did.The author challenged herself by setting the story in the 80s, before most of the forensic devices used in most modern mysteries were available. This backfired in many ways. First, she goes way over the top with the 80s references to the point of distraction. Rather than simply describing what a character is wearing, the book goes into excruciating detail so that there is absolutely no question that it's the 80s. I felt beaten over the head with the era. References to the Golden Girls, the Cosby Show, some new artist named Madonna, ruffled socks and pumps, waterfall bangs - you name it, there's a reference to it that distracts you from the story.Second, there was very little creativity put into the forensics. For all of its mention in the foreword, it had very little to do with ultimately solving the mystery. Ultimately, if you want to read about the birth of forensics and profiling, I found early Patricia Cornwell books a much better read."}, {"userName": "Book Him Danno", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/872245-book-him-danno", "userReview": "Wow that was a suspense filled book that kept me on the edge of my seat...who is the killer and will he or she kill again?

Wow it was scary I was shaking at the end with wonder if the murder would be caught. Read this book. WowA murder mystery that I didn\u2019t want to put down. Tami wove a story that kept you turning the page wanting answers to the questions your mind was asking. Who would do such a thing, who killed those women, why the park, what happens to a person to make then enjoy killing another, how young are serial killers made? Deeper then the Dead is well written, fasted paced and I couldn\u2019t wait to get back to it every time I put it down. This is a fantastic \u2018Who Dunnit?\u2019 It will keep you guessing to the end\u2026lots of false assumptions and trails to follow and wonder about. Lots of blood and abuse this is not for the Cozy reader. I was shaking as I read the climax of the book.

This is #1 in series and even better than the only other one I read/listened to so far (#3: Down the Darkest Road). In spite of the harsh content of serial killer along w/some disfunctional and abusive couples and parents, I liked the storyline, the telling of it and narrating of audio version and loved many of the reoccurring characters. I really found little to complain about. Even though audio is over 13 hrs is seemed to fly by and easily finished it in just over 2 days, but if I had more listening time I could have listened to it and finished it even sooner.

California, 1984. Three children, running in the woods behind their school, stumble upon a partially buried female body, eyes and mouth glued shut. Close behind the children is their teacher, Anne Navarre, shocked by this discovery and heartbroken as she witnesses the end of their innocence. What she doesn't yet realize is that this will mark the end of innocence for an entire community, as the ties that bind families and friends are tested by secrets uncovered in the wake of a serial killer's escalating activity. Detective Tony Mendez, fresh from a law enforcement course at FBI headquarters, is charged with interpreting those now revealed secrets. He's using a new technique-profiling-to develop a theory of the case, a strategy that pushes him ever deeper into the lives of the three children, and closer to the young teacher whose interest in recent events becomes as intense as his own. As new victims are found and the media scrutiny of the investigation bears down on them, both Mendez and Navarre are unsure if those who suffer most are the victims themselves-or the family and friends of the killer, blissfully unaware that someone very close to them is a brutal, calculating psychopath.", "title": "Deeper Than the Dead\n      \n          (Oak Knoll #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6353919.Deeper_Than_the_Dead__Oak_Knoll__1_", "average": 4.06, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1437928498l/6353919.jpg", "reviews": 1516, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9890.Tami_Hoag", "name": "Tami Hoag"}], "type": ["Thriller", "Suspense", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6353919-deeper-than-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7118796-deeper-than-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7846408-deeper-than-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7290786-deeper-than-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1747182.Deeper_Than_the_Dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9808813-deeper-than-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8966629-deeper-than-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8317178-deeper-than-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9169532-deeper-than-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84847.Ashes_to_Ashes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7907680-secrets-to-the-grave", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84844.Guilty_as_Sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84842.Prior_Bad_Acts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10778948-down-the-darkest-road"]}
