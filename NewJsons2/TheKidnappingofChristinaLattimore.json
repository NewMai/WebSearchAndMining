Saying that: I figured out what was going to happen about 1/4 of the way through the book- and then after 1/2 the way through I kept skipping ahead- so I just stopped reading it. I think the reason I couldn't quite get through it is because the author is a 70 something year old woman who is trying to sound like a teenager- she just doesn't capture the emotions, immaturity, insecurities, cares and vernacular of an actual teenager. She tries, but it just ends up sounding like an old woman pretending to be a teenager (not that I have anything against older writers- they are often more wise- but I just didn't like this one). The whole thing just didn't work for me. Plus, the author uses the word giggle too much. I just don't like that word."}, {"userName": "Dylan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33572178-dylan", "userReview": "*I'm trying to write something for every book I read this year so I'm going back and writing at least a sentence for each book I read** This was stupid lol.

Book Review 516 November 2010The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore:When Proving your Innocence Isn\u2019t as Easy as it Looks \tIt\u2019s quite hard to admit that someone you know could be a criminal. Christina Lattimore, a teenage girl living in Houston, is put in this situation when she realizes that more than one person she\u2019s known for her whole life could\u2019ve been involved in an act that could put them a way for a good amount of time. This act involved kidnapping Christina Lattimore and stealing from Christina\u2019s millionaire grandmother. After a couple days, Christina is found, but is then accused of being involved in this elaborate scheme. While this sounds crazy, proving her innocence is not as easy as it seems. The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore is a mystery/thriller written in the suspenseful words of Joan Lowery Nixon. I would give this book four stars. The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore is a suspenseful book because each chapter leaves you with a question, there is always an unsolved clue, and you gradually gain knowledge from each character. The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore is a suspenseful book because each chapter leaves you with a question. Many of the last sentences in the chapters leave you confused. In chapter six, Christina talks to Detective York about the kidnapping, and it seems like he believes her enough to make sure she isn\u2019t tried as a criminal. However, the chapter ends with Detective York saying, \u201cThey aren\u2019t coming... I advised them not to.\u201d, referring to whether or not Christina\u2019s parents are coming to meet her at the police station. I didn\u2019t understand why she was being treated as a criminal, if she had proved her innocence. York\u2019s reason is later explained, though.\tThe Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore is a suspenseful book, because there is always an unsolved clue. Christina often has a clue in the back of her mind, and knows it\u2019s important, but she can\u2019t seem to figure out what it is. She says, \u201cSomething in the back of my head nags me. I\u2019ve had this feeling before. Something isn\u2019t quite right, but I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d At this point, she is thinking about something that her maid Della had said, but it doesn\u2019t come out for some time, while the suspense builds up.\tAnother way The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore is a suspenseful book is because you gradually gain knowledge of each character. Sometimes the character themselves directly gives out information, and sometimes it is found out through Christina. When Della confronts Christina on the kidnapping, she gives away information that she did not mean to give out, but is something that would help prove Christina\u2019s innocence a lot more easily. First of all, she asked Christina if she had gotten her typewriter back from the kidnapper\u2019s house. Christina realizes that there is no way, she could\u2019ve known about that unless she was somehow involved. Also, Della really tries to persuade Christina to not work on the case. This helped Christina come to the conclusion that she must\u2019ve had to have a valid reason for trying to persuade her.\tThe Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore is a suspenseful book because each chapter leaves you with a question, there is always an unsolved clue, and you gradually gain knowledge from each character. I realized after writing this review, how much I actually enjoyed reading this book. I did not think it would even be half as good as it was. The main character, Christina, reminds me very much of the main character in the book, Frozen Fire."}, {"userName": "Steven Mcgill", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36010356-steven-mcgill", "userReview": "The genre for the Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore is a Fiction/Mystery. The setting of the story is Houston, Texas. The characters who are in the story are Loretta, Zack, Cristabel, T.J. Kelly, Mr. and Mrs. Lattimore, Della, and Rosella. The conflict is that Christina Lattimore gets kidnapped by zack and Loretta then they try to frame her for making it seem like a kidnapping so now she has to prove her innocence. I didn't really have any complications with the book, it was pretty clear about everything.I liked a lot of things about the book. The main thing that I liked was that it is in first person. This helped me understand what was going on in Christina's mind while all this is happening and see things from her view. There's not much to dislike about the book, it was well written and dramatic. This book made me become a fan of Mystery books because of the wonder of always wanting to see what's going to happen next.Overall the book is great and I would recommend it to anyone. The main age group that it would appeal to is teenagers that are about 15-17. I would say that because the age of the main career so it would relate back to a lot of the readers that are around this age range.

True, it did have a good pacing so it was a pretty quick read, but it was just all so improbable. I wont give those spoilers away to prove my point though.The characters were ok, but not really very relatable for me. I did not feel like they had much depth, or really a story behind their characters, kind of one dimensional. Even the bad guys were not really bad guys I did not think. They were just kind of there. I am guessing maybe it was tamed a bit because it was a YA Mystery?I also really wanted a little more excitement to the story. I mean the girl was kidnapped, that would call for some scary parts or some adrenalin pumping action of some kind right? It was more like she was a guest in someone's home.

Christina solves her whole own mystery with the help of her friend Kelly and ends up proving herself to her family. No sentence was particularly significant to me in this book, but my favorite would probably be, \"I've seen people look at a dead cat in the street with more interest than he shows when he looks at me now.\" Christina says this when describing the way Detective York, the detective for her case, talks to her.

The writing was a good balance between action and description that made it enjoyable to read. The plot was predictable at times, but was still entertaining and had an interesting spin on classic kidnapping stories.The biggest issue I had was with the characters. The protagonist, Christina, was whiny, one dimensional, and very concerned with her reputation. Christina was immature and unrealistic and I think she ruined what could have been a much better plotline. The other characters were very shallow as well. Christina's best friend was a bit of a Mary Sue, and a few characters added nothing to the story. I was also annoyed that there wasn't more emphasis on the antagonists reasons for doing the things they did (ex. why did her kidnappers kidnap her?) since it could have become much more of a psychological thriller. There were only two characters I really liked in the entire story. I would suggest this book to a reader who likes interesting plots and doesn't mind shallow characters.

I can understand why many people disagree. This is a young adult mystery suspense but it was published in 1979. Many people, many young people would not enjoy this because it is young adult from a different era. Is it irony that this was one of the reasons that I enjoyed it so much? Having been a teenager in the 1990's I did grow up without the modern technologies that we take for granted today. Also having been a teen in the 1990's, I read many young adult novels right on par with this one. It was such a different time and these older novels don't have much in common with young adult novels today. Many young people will probably think its so old fashioned that its boring or that they simply are'nt able to connect with the characters. That may be true enough, but is it fair?When I'm rating a book I put a lot of checklists in place. For instance, is the book well written for the time and for the intended age group of that time? This book was. I never judge young adult books by the same standards that I judge adult. I never judge children's books like I judge young adult or adult. There may be all kinds of reasons that I could like a particular book More, but it might not fit with the genre or the intended audience age group. I think that you have to make an honest attempt to be objective in that sense. I find quite often that most people rating books are not placing anything but their personal opinions into book ratings. The truth is, this is an excellent book, it is concise and well written. The writing style is early young adult from around 1979. If you can accept this book knowing and understanding these things you might actually really enjoy it. It was refreshing to me in so many ways specifically Because of the time it was written. There were no mentions of modern technology, teens were respectful to their parents, there wasn't a lot of slang or cursing, there wasn't a bunch of sex or characters longing to have sex and there weren't a bunch of old tropes! As an adult reading this, yes it was simplistic - but in a way that you would expect young adult novels to be back then. It was actually written with a good pace. It is well written for a young adult novel from 1979. It was dramatic without being too dramatic, parts were frightening but not too frightening. What I am getting at is that this novel had an excellent balance. Its a good mystery. I read a lot of mystery and I usually figure them out but this book did keep me guessing until the end."}, {"userName": "Shaylee Shedenhelm", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71195929-shaylee-shedenhelm", "userReview": "Christina Lattimore\u2019s life was not going as well as she planned.

But, I thought some things could have been better. Such as, I think it could have been better if the author would have given us more on why someone would have wanted Christina to be kidnapped so that we as readers could understand why the kidnappers kidnapped her. I also wish they would have given the readers more of what her parents and friends were thinking when they found out that Christina was kidnapped and what they did to try to find her.

The attackers, Zack and Loretta Tigus, I found were the best characters, they didn\u2019t have the average rough personality or the abusive tendencies towards their victims which added to the suspense and questions.

I would recommend the book to readers that are looking for a short mystery novel but not for big fans of mystery because I believe they would find it too simple and predictable, but I know the author, Joan Lowery Nixon, writes other and more advanced novels.

It was copyrighted in 1979, and it should have stayed in that decade. I've read children's picture books with characters with far more depth, story lines much more unpredictable, and more expressive use of language. This book is boring from start to finish. The characters are shallow and not relatable. The ending is underdeveloped and obvious. If I could give this book zero stars, I would."}, {"userName": "Ericha", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2298739-ericha", "userReview": "This was an okay read. I liked the premise of the novel, and the slightly successful attempt for a strong female character. However, it was slow-paced, the emotions felt a little too dry for me, and the ending was incredibly underwhelming."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22838910-amy", "userReview": "A great and quick middle grade kidnapping story."}, {"userName": "Jersey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79770095-jersey", "userReview": "Very suspenseful.
