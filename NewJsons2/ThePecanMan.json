A native of northern Florida, Dandridge got the ideas for the three main characters in the novel from her Leesburg upbringing. Only 136 pages, the novel, which I have dubbed To Kill a Mockingbird meets A Time to Kill, packs a punch. Ora Lee Beckworth has only been widowed for a little under a year when she hires Eldres Mims to mow her lawn and tend her shrubbery. Beckworth tolerates all people but her neighbors lead by Dovey Kincaid start spreading rumors about the homeless black man and plead with Beckworth to fire him. Meanwhile Blanche Lowery her loyal housekeeper for over thirty years feels uncomfortable around him as well yet can not pinpoint it. Beckworth allows Mims to keep his job. One day Beckworth arrives home from an errand to find Blanche rocking her youngest daughter Grace on a porch chair. Horrifyingly it turns out she has just been raped by the town police chief's only son. In the post civil rights, south, however, Blanche could not report the crime because the town still sees things in black and white. At this time, Ora Lee, in need of more companionship of her own, brings the Lowery family into her home and treats them as family. Yet many things go unspoken between Ora Lee and Blanche, creating a web of lies that would last for many years. As the book progresses, Ora Lee grows closer to Blanche and her daughters, while also growing closer to Eldred Mims. You can see that Ora Lee is a respected member of her community, having taught many of the younger generation in Sunday school, and having a vested interest in their lives. It is from this unique vantage point that she is able to assist Eldred Mims and the Lowery family in the horrible things that befall them as the book moves towards its denouement. It is alarming to think that as recent as the late 1970s that racism still reared its ugly head in the south. Yet, unfortunately, that still exists today. Vacationing many times in Florida, I witnessed a schism in white and black society. Blacks are today still accused of crimes they may or may not have committed. Selleck here paints a picture of a Florida community in the post civil rights era, where unfortunately most people still see things in black and white. I enjoyed this book as a poignant debut by Cassie Dandridge Selleck. I would recommend The Pecan Man to those looking for quality southern style fiction, and I look forward to reading more works by the author."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27709782-jen", "userReview": "It's the 70's. A crime happens to a young black child. A white has committed the crime but a black takes the fall.

There is a similar feeling and atmosphere .....Compare the stories or not... I Absolutely loved listening to THIS story...The narrator's voice gave me confidence that I was in good hands. She was warm, extremely kind, and trustworthy. Here is another book where over a thousand readers on Goodreads have read it before me. The overall rating is 4.3. I'm giving it a solid 5 stars! Thank you to several friends who told me to read this book without telling me of anything about it. The author is self published - first novel ---kudos to the author: Cassie Dandridge Selleck.Great natural flowing storytelling - intimate with the characters, wonderful dialogue--loved the accents of the characters on the audiobook. A cozy warm feeling spread through my own body from:.....the relationships ( appreciations and love of each other).....sharing cups of tea, .....shopping at JC Pennies, ......eating a hot dog and Cherry Coke at Woolworths, ......buying 4 bicycles for 4 young girls for a Christmas present .....storytelling while polishing silverI loved the intimacy of the dialogue. The deeper issues are as sad as can be ... and just because we've heard them before, doesn't make them any less sad. There's a heartbreaking story being told! There is NO QUESTION that this was well written... engaging....and emotionally felt!For walkers .... or Commuters: I highly recommend this audiobook. It's the type of story where we - as readers & listeners - elevate our own energy, spirit and heart.

I promised.\" Until a crisp, unsoiled copy lay on a side table at the library book sale. I bit in and cracked open this ol' nut with much surprise.The heat of summer blanketed the small town of Mayville, Florida. It's 1976 and America is caught up in the throws of bi-centennial fever. A fever felt by many and a barely registering pulse in the midst of the forgotten. The fireworks elicite a tilt of the head toward the night sky while leaving the grounding reality of life in total darkness where one stands on their side of the street.Ora Lee Beckwith, a recent widow, hires an old homeless man to do her yardwork. He's been seen up and down the neighborhood on his ancient, rusted bicycle. He's been tabbed with a name by the locals. It's Pecan Man coming down the street garnering pecans left in the gutters and distant sidewalks. But to Ora Lee, he will become Eddie and he will become the most dynamic agent of change in her life.And you will experience a transformation before your eyes as you turn page after page. Together with her stoic maid, Blanche, Ora Lee will take you on a journey that will leave you frustrated beyond words, exasperated at the lowly ignorance of people in high positions, and wounded by the sheer disregard of humanity found in its legal system.

A very simply told story by a very flawed Ora. A story with many moral implications and one that left me wondering what I would have done? Would I have done differently?

Set in Florida during the mid-1970's, the widowed Ora Lee lives a very comfortable life with the assistance of her black housekeeper, Blanche Lowery, a single mother of five struggling to make ends meet. When Eldred Mims, a homeless black man known to the town citizens as The Pecan Man, sets up residence in the nearby woods, racism rears its ugly head. When Ora Lee hires the docile Eldred Mims to help out with the yard work, she learns a lot about herself as well as her relationships with not only this man but with Blanche as well. When tragedy strikes, the finger is pointed at Eldred Mims, but Ora Lee knows the truth. But if justice is served at the price of great sacrifice, then how does one make the choice to come forward with the truth? A tale of friendship and family that crosses barriers, The Pecan Man is a lovely short novel with some hopeful messages. Where there are wrongs, there are still those trying to do right. Despite great sorrow, one can still experience joy. Ora Lee tells us a story that will warm your heart even as you shudder at the cruelties and injustices in this world."}, {"userName": "Cathrine \u262f\ufe0f ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine", "userReview": "3.75\u2605At just under 150 pages this is a small gem and perfect reading material during those in between times when you need something that will not make demands on you.

It was expertly narrated and settled on me like home-style comfort food over a cold rainy weekend. No problem for me at all staying focused or kept in a state of enjoyment. During the 1970s in a small southern town an ugly crime begets another resulting in a murder charge.

It also deals with the racial issues of that time."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara", "userReview": "Don\u2019t be fooled by the slender appearance of this novel, it is meaty. It speaks to the time in which it is set, 1976 Mayville, Florida, but it speaks to today just as clearly and it teaches lesson about where we have been and also where we are now.I could not help thinking about all the homeless individuals that crowd our city streets, who are passed by daily and treated like the great unwashed. Beneath each of those faces is a person, an individual, and while some of them might fit the stereotypes we impose upon them, most do not, but if we never look beyond the surface, we will never know that. Selleck\u2019s pecan man is one of those individuals. Ora Lee initially sees only his surface, but as the novel progresses, we are allowed to see beneath it and glimpse the complicated human being who occupies his skin.And, skin is also a theme. The color of skin is a subject that gets discussed often these days, and in literary circles the tales that involve skin color are often so lopsided that you are only hearing one voice or another. Selleck has managed to allow us to hear all the voices. She has created flawed human beings, who make earth-shattering decisions because they must, and sometimes choose the wrong path and sometimes do not know, even twenty-five years later, if the path they chose was the correct one. Because paths, like people, are hard to define. They are made up of so many twists and turns and unseen corners. I loved all the people in this book: Ora Lee, Eldred Mims, Blanche Lowery, Marcus, Judge Harley Odell, Chip Smallwood...I loved them because if you scratch their skin, they bleed, and if you want to pigeonhole them, they defy you.One of the lessons I took away from this book was that we can mean the best, be good and kind people, and still we can hurt someone or hold them back with some subtle behavior that we are cognitively unaware of. What makes Ora Lee a wonderful woman is not that she is perfect, but that she strives to see her flaws and when she does to correct them. Can we ask anything more of one another than that?"}, {"userName": "PorshaJo", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464046-porshajo", "userReview": "Rating a 4.5I am glad I did not write up my best books of the year yet....as this one is sure to make the list. Southern literary fiction at it's finest. The Pecan Man tells the story of \"Eddie\" Mims, the Peecan Man as the kids call him, and what happened that year to him in the summer of 1976. But more importantly, it introduces the wonderful character of Mrs. Ora Lee Beckworth. Ora Lee is recently widowed and hires the Pecan Man to do mowing and gardening around her house a few days a week. Ora Lee is fiesty and *very* strong willed, yet she oozes that good ol' southern charm. The Pecan Man is accused of the murder of the local police chief's son when he is found near where he camps/lives. But Ora Lee knows that Eddie did not commit this murder. In the 70's in the south, racism was everywhere, blacks were somewhat segregated still, and when a crime was committed, they were the first to be accused. So no one is shocked when Eddie is put in jail for the rest of his life for his murder. Now, twenty five years later, Ora Lee is telling her story of that fateful night in an effort to clear Eddie's name. More importantly, she learns how one lie spins a web of many lies, in which you must remember each and every one of them, and that there are consequences that you must face for this.I listened to this one via audio and it was wonderful. One of my top audios of all time. The narrator was amazing and really brought this story to life. I ended up grabbing this one due to all the high praise I have seen about it on GR and I'm so glad I did. It deserves all this praise and more. I strongly suggest if you have yet to read this one, try the audio. A wonderful gem from Cassie Dandridge Selleck that I look forward to re-reading in the near future."}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "The Pecan Man: One Most Folks Would Rather Not See\n  The Pecan Man by Cassie Dandridge Selleck was selected by members of On the Southern Literary Trail as a group read for January, 2016.

Lock the doors. Bring it up at the next neighborhood association meeting. Perhaps report the offender to the Neighborhood Crime Watch Program.Cassie Dandridge Selleck has written a thoughtful tale of one of those \"others\" in The Pecan Man. It is a simple tale, almost fable like. And I enjoyed it, up to a point.It is 1976 in the small southern town of Mayville. The residents there embrace their town as a reflection of Macomb, Alabama, of To Kill a Mockingbird. One jokes, \"That May sure gets around.\" It is an indication that not many things have changed since the 1930s. But they have. Mayville seems unaffected by The Voting Rights Acr of 1965. Yet, the Civil Rights Movement was still active in the 1970s. These were the years of school desegregation. The times are changing.Ora Lee Beckworth, a recent widow, narrates the story.\u201cThe events of that year were the real driving force behind the mass exodus from the neighborhood. It was the year of the Pecan Man. None of us knew how much impact one skinny old colored man could have in our lives, but we found out soon enough.\u201d\u201cWhen you're as old as I am, it takes a while to make a point. The Pecan Man had a name - Eldred Mims. I called him Eddie. The people of Mayville didn\u2019t know his name at all, until he was arrested and charged with the murder of a sixteen year old boy named Skipper Kornegay.\u201d Ora Lee, through this short novel, must acknowlege she has looked the other way. In the process she learns a great deal of truth about herself. She surprises us by telling that after twenty-five years, she has decided to tell the truth about the Pecan Man no matter what the cost. Twenty years after Eldred Mims was tried and convicted for the murder of Skipper Kornegay, who just happened to be the son of the County Sheriff.\u201cOnce a lie is told, you have to keep on telling it. You not only have to repeat it time and time again, you have to embellish it, layer upon layer until you don\u2018t even remember the truth.\u201d Ora Lee is not without her faults. She is a flawed character, which she comes to realize. In her 1970s world, Ora Lee hires Eldred Mims to cut her grass. She has a maid Branch Lowery, whom she requires to wear a uniform. They are servants to her.But through the course of the story, Blanche, her children, Grace, Patrice, ReNetta, and the Pecan Man become intimately known to her. Ora Lee learns that family does not mean only blood kin. Each of these former servants and the children become an integral part of her life. In sharing Thanksgiving and Christmas with them, she is transformed into a much more loving and caring woman.Why was Skipper Kornegay killed? Why was the Pecan Man arrested? Why did Ora Lee Beckwith withold the truth for twenty-five years before deciding to tell the truth? These are the questions that form the central themes of Selleck's novel. To disclose the answers would spoil this nice story for future readers. I won't do that.As the reader discovers the answers to those questions, a quandary arises. The individual reader must decide whether they find themselves comfortable with Ora Lee's tale, or whether the Truth of the matter makes them squirm with what to me were uncomfortable answers. Perhaps, reader, you find this remark cryptic. Accept it. Each reader must determine their reaction to this story.Without doubt, this is a poignant story that has the possibility of touching the reader in more ways than one. None of us is perfect. Being human, we make mistakes we regret and wonder whether we or deserving of forgiveness or the hope of redemption. In some ways, each of us owes a debt for each of our mistakes. Eldred Mims sums it up:\u201cI reckon I'm the bes' judge of that. Sometimes the debt you pay ain't exactly the one you owe, but it works out jus' the same anyway. Lord knows I done caused my share of heartache in this life.\u201d Hasn't everyone? The heart of every fable is the moral of it. Each reader must determine the moral of this one. You may find some truth about yourself when you do. Perhaps, go shopping down at the Star Market."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4133569-cathy", "userReview": "Spent a day at the beach with \"The Pecan Man\". Loved this book! I'm taking a break from mysteries and enjoying some time spent in the South. The Kitchen House got me started with a story of the south during the 1800s. The Dry Grass of August and The Pecan Man take place in the 50s. If you liked The Help, you'll want to read all three of these. I'm finding the relationships between the whites and blacks most interesting, especially the white children and their maids, who pretty much took over parenting.

The fact that it was pretty short and a good candidate for a book that I could read with my teenage daughter tipped the scale. I\u2019m very glad that it did.The Pecan Man takes place in the fictional town of Mayville, in Central Florida in 1976. It tells the story of Ora Lee Beckworth, an elderly white woman, Blanche Lowery, her friend and maid, and Eldred Mims (aka the pee-can man) , a homeless black man who tends Ora Lee\u2019s yard. It is a story of racism, a horrific crime and brutal revenge but mostly it is the story of family and a wonderful friendship that crosses the color line. Although it is fiction, it reads very much like a true story. Too often in fiction the trauma caused by evil deeds is washed away by the story\u2019s resolution. The urge to wrap things up in a neat package often takes place at the expense of reality.

Several people, I believe, mentioned that it was part To Kill a Mockingbird with various secondary novels. I can see the comparison, the easy, flowing prose, the narrator\u2019s, Ora, voice, her style of meandering through days. Honestly, Ora\u2019s voice reminded far more of the movie version of \u201cFried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Caf\u00e9.\u201d Ora\u2019s voice, to me was very similar to Jessica Tandy\u2019s / Ninny Threadgoode. The Pecan Man has it\u2019s own little mysterious interwoven stories that create the same kind of easy dialogue involving at least one dark secret. Ora Lee Beckworth, a widow, lives in a charming house near downtown; she can sit on her front porch and watch life pass by. Since she\u2019s recently widowed, she hasn\u2019t done much but do just that. With her husband gone, though, she does need a man to tend the yard work, and maybe a few odd jobs around the house. When she notices the \u201cPecan Man,\u201d a somewhat raggedy-looking, homeless man on with a beat-up old bike wandering in her neighborhood, she asks him if he\u2019d be interested in doing some yard work on a weekly basis. She already has a housekeeper, Blanche, who helps with everything else she needs inside. Needless to say, at least one neighbor, Dovey, across the street, of course, has to step in after a few weeks of the Pecan man being seen in their neighborhood, it just isn\u2019t safe, she says. He makes her uneasy, scares people, and well, after all, you wouldn\u2019t want people driving through here thinking he actually lived there, would you? This was a short, delightful read.

The story doesn't deal with this properly. Secondly, Eddie, who is charged for the death of Ralph's son, Skipper, decides to plead guilty because he fears he has not the will-power to stop drinking. He reasons it is better to be in a prison with food and a roof over his head than to die as he envisions alone out in the woods. I do not believe such an unstable person would not waver and change his mind. I don\u2019t find his decision plausible in the long run.

Set in a small southern town in the 70's stirred many memories for me, the town I grew up in has 1 red light. My grandmother had a long front porch with 8 rocking chairs, my Dad had a pecan orchard where I picked up pecans. I found this book to be faithful and true to the history and traditions of the south. The character and setting development were great. Mrs. Selleck doesn't hesitate to pull back the covers and expose the deliberate and unintended racism that we southerners have struggled to overcome for years. Once I started reading I couldn't put this book down. A story of love and enlightenment. The \"Pee-can\"Man was self published, I certainly hope to see more from Mrs. Selleck, a great storyteller!"}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6217162-donna", "userReview": "I'm sure the author had good intentions with this book, but sometimes that's just not enough. This story didn't sit right with me mainly because of the emphasis it had on a white person acting as savior to all the black people around her, as if they couldn't manage their lives on their own or make correct decisions for themselves or even make mistakes without her interference and her money helping them along. And even though there is a certain amount of kindness shown by the main character, Ora, and enlightenment gained on her part as she's looking back on events to set the record straight about a murder, I still felt the author went as overboard as Ora did in trying to make her into someone admirable, and it had the opposite effect.I think this story was supposed to be, in equal parts, a heartbreaking and heartwarming tale. But it did very little for me in either area. The story did hold my interest, as did certain characters such as Blanche, Ora's maid and eventual friend. But the author was trying too hard to influence my emotions and she manipulated her characters to achieve it. Consequently, I never bought into this story or the believability of many characters, excluding \"The Pecan Man\" himself, an old black man whose real name was Eldred \"Eddie\" Mims. The bulk of the story takes place in the summer of 1976 in Mayville, Florida, a small town where racial prejudice resides. Ora Lee Beckworth, 57 and a recent widow, lives in a neighborhood she feels has gone downhill since a rehab center was built there. And many of the residents have been relocating because of it ever since, and because of Eddie Mims who lives in the woods on its outskirts and regularly passes through town on his bicycle. He always seems to have two sacks of pecans attached to the handlebars, nuts he's gathered from the ground so as not to steal from anyone's trees. Against everyone's advice, Ora takes pity on him and asks Eddie to mow her lawn and do small gardening chores for her, having seen how skinny he is and thinking he must be going hungry. A meal each workday is part of the deal she strikes with him along with the wages she offers an initially reluctant Eddie. Things go well until an unthinkable act of violence occurs and retribution for that act takes place, with Eddie caught up in the middle of it. What follows is a tale of regret, sacrifice, and a search for justice and atonement, a number of the characters' relationships shifting gears along the way as they come to see each other as people first and not by their skin color or position in town. For these elements alone, I have rated this book three stars. And had the author simply gone this route and told this story as such without Ora overcompensating outrageously with her benevolence for something only she could fathom was lacking in herself, the book might have been worth more than an average rating to me. One thing is for certain. This was no To Kill a Mockingbird, a book some people have compared it to. It doesn't have the depth, emotionally or otherwise, nor does it preserve the dignity of many of its characters. Instead, it's a story told by Ora from 25 years in the future so she may clear her conscience and achieve some closure and a sense of peace for herself and others. Unfortunately, this brief story left me wanting much more, and it left me with more than a little unease concerning Ora, something I'll be discussing with my book club when we meet to share our perspectives."}, {"userName": "LeAnne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-leanne", "userReview": "This was one of the best narrations of an audio book I've ever listened to. Dictated as a confession to her part in a killing decades earlier, the 80 year old protagonist tells one hell of a story. At its heart, this tale is about lies, and whether well intended or not, the cost that they exact on the human heart - the heart that is neither white nor black.Up until the last handful of chapters, I would have awarded this book a pure 5 star rating. The last chapters acted as a sort of epilogue describing the adult lives of Blanche's children, and those chapters could have been condensed in my opinion. The final chapter, with a bit of a bombshell in it, is one I would have enjoyed more had it been expanded. The Pecan Man is still excellent."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54266751-jennifer", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book, the author's writing style, and thought she did a great job describing the main characters and the scenes.

I love Southern stories and The Pecan Man is now one of them. Selleck does a wonderful job of letting the reader glimpse the South, full of injustices, changes, heartbreak, class and racism. The story is told by Ora Lee Beckworth, a \"genteel\" woman of privilege who is wise beyond her years. She is a good woman and when a horrible act enters her home by way of her housekeepers children she shows just what she is made of. She feels she is naive, but maybe not so much as we see her grow into herself. She builds a family, even while not always realizing she is. She and \"the pee-can\" man are the heroes of this story. Sad, as it is a true commentary of life in the south some years ago and still today in many places. Yet this is also a hopeful story, and one I will not soon forget. It was a pleasure to find this gem of a book. Would recommend it to lovers of Southern stories."}, {"userName": "LA", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/960504-la", "userReview": "Though this book was an interesting read and well-written, something irked me while reading it. I know the author did not set out for it to be offensive - she nearly says as much in the intro, but in some way it still is by romanticizing the relationship of a white woman and her African-American maid. Yes, the lady of the house was portrayed as very progressive, but I can't help but feel that the storyline was written for a white audience to read and pat themselves on the back for being \"the good guys\" during a still horrible time in the American South even though Jim Crow laws were officially over. I wonder how different the story would have been if someone would have given the pen to the housekeeper."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26560507-heather", "userReview": "\"Once a lie is told, you have to keep on telling it.
