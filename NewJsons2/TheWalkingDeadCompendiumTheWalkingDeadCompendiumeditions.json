People died. And nothing would be the same anymore. For better or worse.Enter: Sgt. Abraham Ford......, brawny former soldier who can give to The Rock or Sgt. Slaughter a run for their money.New people got in the mix of Rick\u2019s group and while the interaction gets shaken AND stirred between the remaining members of Rick\u2019s group and the new arrivals, they find a common goal to look for.Now, instead of just wandering aimlessly, a new merged group is forged, still under the leadership of Rick Grimes, and now they have a clear destination.Chapter Ten\n  WHAT WE BECOME\nRating: ***** ( 5 stars )\n  You\u2019re some brilliant scientist \u2013 working for the government \u2013 and you wear a mullet?\nRick\u2019s group have a clear destination, but one thing is to know where to head to, and another is being able to reach there.And if you think that a bunch of zombies were dangerous, just wait for a dang herd...Do you remember good old Morgan from the first chapter and also starring a Christmas Special? Well, his Christmas became a living ( or more accurate) a dead Halloween, a walking dead Halloween. And with nothing to lose, he will be part of Rick\u2019s group.And as I told you before, zombies are easy to understand, people don\u2019t, and in this dystopian crazy world, kids are no longer really kids anymore.Chapter Eleven\n  FEAR THE HUNTERS\nRating: ***** ( 5 stars )\n  And in the end, when it\u2019s over \u2013 I won\u2019t hesitate.\nYou may think that in an insane world where men-eater zombies are everywhere, those would be your highest threat, but hardly, since there is a more deadly predator to men......other men.And the worse of that is that men always will have the need of eating.Hunger is a bitch for evolution.The roles of predators and prey can be too easily interchangeable, and in this new dark world, love is the most tested emotion...Chapter Twelve\n  LIFE AMONG THEM\nRating: **** ( 4 stars )\n  I\u2019m really good good with a gun\u2026 \u2026Very goddamn good. It\u2019s kind of ridiculous.\nWelcome to Alexandria.Rick\u2019s group is now in a whole new situation......living in a civilized community.And this can be ironically as unsettled and volatile as living on the road facing zombies.You can\u2019t be living out there, sleeping with one eye open, seeing your teammates dying without notice, killing zombies, killing\u2026 men, without losing an irrecoverable piece of your soul, and certainly getting back to live in society can\u2019t be the same anymore.Now the question is from whom do you have to be really afraid now?Chapter Thirteen\n  TOO FAR GONE\nRating: **** ( 4 stars )\n  I remember when you didn\u2019t want to be the leader. That\u2019s what made you a good one.\nRick\u2019s group collide with Alexandria\u2019s community while living inside of the same walls.Leaderships are tested.Loyalties fall down.Romances are in a mess.Mental health is long gone.Living AND dead menaces are in their own ways toward them...Chapter Fourteen\n  NO WAY OUT\nRating: ***** ( 5 stars )\n  Well, boys\u2026 Good plan so far. Now what?\nRick\u2019s group is again......Rick\u2019s group......but now it\u2019s larger......and so its the menace falling over it too.Alexandria is under masive zombie attack and it will be impossible that everybody would get alive from this...Chapter Fifteen\n  WE FIND OURSELVES\nRating: ***** ( 5 stars )\n  Good effort everyone \u2013 but save your bullets. I\u2019ll take it from here.\nMaybe the herd is over, but hardly Rick\u2019s group is safe again, and definitely they got out from that soaked with blood, all over their bodies and deeply inside of their souls.Hope is not here anymore, but the quest for recovering hope in the community of Alexandria maybe it will be the only thing saving them from getting totally insane.However, they still are in the slow and hard working process of finding hope, so there is still plenty of time to get crazy between each other.And if they really want someday to have hope again, somebody will have to take the hard decisions...Chapter Sixteen\n  A LARGER WORLD\nRating: **** ( 4 stars )\n  I\u2019m not talking to a fucking hat.\nRick\u2019s group is facing challenges in many fronts. Food is scarce. Ammo is low. Faith is even lower. But winter is coming......and so is Jesus...Enter: Paul Monroe......, or as his friends call him... Jesus.Rick\u2019s group will meet this man who works in mysterious ways and sometimes do some miracles, but no, he\u2019s not that Jesus... isn\u2019t him?Jesus aka Paul Monroe appears with good news and the word is......trading!He will explain Rick\u2019s group how their world is bigger than they thought possible. A world with other groups, other communities.And it seems that they only way that all these groups may survive is creating a trading system.But as you can guess, this just can\u2019t be as easy as it sounds.\n  If we kill all these bad guys, will you start to giving us half of your food and stuff?\nIf you think that the problem was that zombies would get increase their numbers, you\u2019re wrong......the uncertain new scenario is that men are getting to be more of them...This is......\n  THE WALKING DEAD!!!"}, {"userName": "Shelby *trains flying monkeys*", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1053760-shelby-trains-flying-monkeys", "userReview": "The season for Walking Dead has ended and my library finally got in my copy of this book. *fangirls*I very rarely watch tv. Everyone asks how I read as much as I do and it is that simple of an answer. The Walking Dead show is one that I do make time and get a bit cray-cray if someone calls me during it.It's amazing to me how different they have made the show but been able to keep some of the elements of the books. I honestly think I'm more of a fan of the show than the books, not that they aren't good too. The show to me just fleshes out the story so much more. I care more for the characters, most of them get on my nerves in the books. I'm looking at you Maggie.If you worry about reading the books and spoiling the show, don't. They are so different that you feel like two different stories are taking place that just happen to involve some of the same people.You have no Daryl, Carol, or Sasha in this collection of the books. I miss them. You still have these though:\n  \n  Rick still has a bit of the crazy going. I'm not caring for the fact that he is still talking to Lori on the phone but who's judging. Look at those eyes and leave the man alone.\n  Towards the end of the book I did notice that some of the stories are starting to repeat themselves and I did find myself losing interest. I'm hoping that does not continue to be a trend."}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char", "userReview": "The second compendium of The Walking Dead was excellent.

I suddenly find myself overcome with something I thought we'd lost... hope.\"Compendium 2 is made up of issues 49-96, i.e. volumes 9-16. Following the loss of the prison and the devastation that followed, Rick and the group must move on. They very quickly come upon a community protected by walls, but the solace does not last long...It's difficult to review these comics as they're so fast moving and so much happens!! That's one of the major positives of The Walking Dead - it doesn't really get stagnant. Even when the survivors settle down in one location for a while, there's always new dangers and new characters constantly being introduced.The general outline and journey of the survivors is similar to that of the show, but there's still huge differences with regards to individual character storylines, so even as a fan of the show, I'm kept on my toes.This compendium was exciting because characters such as Abraham, Eugene, Rosita etc were introduced, as well as those who reside at Alexandria. And then towards the end we get to meet Jesus and those over at Hilltop! And Negan is mentioned!But amidst all the excitement of meeting those characters I know from the show, ultimately... The Walking Dead is bleak. So bleak. It can be exhausting and relentless, but a zombie apocalypse ain't gonna be all sunshine and rainbows! But this compendium really drives the message home that humans are the real danger. Rick and co know how to deal with the walkers now, that's easy (most of the time), it's the people are also just trying to survive that are the problem.Perhaps a bit slow at times but it never lost my attention. I give it 4 stars out of 5!

Me, the great lover of literature would find myself a rabid fan of Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead graphic novel series, and the equally amazing AMC TV series. Actually it was the TV series that got me onto the cult phenomenon of the graphic novels. I happened to notice that AMC was running all of Season Two of TWD the weekend before the premiere for Season Three. I immediately DVR'd all of those rascals, and my wife and I started watching. We are now going back and watching the six episodes of Season One even as we watch Season Three unfold. Once I had started to watch the TV series I just had to find out what this was based upon--ergo my discovery of Kirkman's graphic novel series.This is some seriously crazy and scary shit, folks! No other way to slice and dice it! Kirkman's The Walking Dead is a grim, dark, totally horrifying story that grabs you by the throat and just won't let go. At first it was the \"walkers\" that scared the crap out of me, but after a while I realized that it was the living that were the most terrifying. After all, the zombies just want to eat, and really--to a large degree--can be managed. It is the other human survivors that have proven to be the most dangerous and threatening predators to Rick Grimes and his band in this new apocalyptic landscape that Kirkman has created. And knowing what I know about humanity (and inhumanity), this kinda rings true to me.Anyway, I've always loved a good scary tale, and if you're a lover of Stephen King, Robert McGammon, Justin Cronin, et al., I think I'm safe in suggesting that Robert Kirkman's graphic novel The Walking Dead will fill the bill nicely. The black and white artwork is really quite superb and lends itself so well to this bleak hellish world that Rick and his group are trying to survive in. Perhaps most horrifying is that Rick's mantra of \"Shit happens!\" is pretty much spot-on, with perhaps one additional corollary-- \"Sometimes bad shit happens to good people!\"I have the first 96 issues of TWD in Compendiums One and Two, and have just ordered Volume 17 (collects Issues 97-102), as I don't think I can wait a couple of years for Compendium Three to be released.

The second compendium eventually lands our group in the Alexandria \"Safe Zone\" and the action gets less frequent and the story moves forward much more slowly.

So, yeah, it's slow in stretches but still it's a ridiculous amount of content for the money."}, {"userName": "Yodamom", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905141-yodamom", "userReview": "Wonderful illustrations with all kinds of hidden stuff to look at.

That's what I thought. The first bit of it was so agonizing to read/watch unfold before my eyes. The amount of pain and hurt people endure in this story is truly brutal. In fact alot of this novel was really dealing with alot of heartache and how people go on in the midst of it all.However by mid way the story got more positive. Still dealing with a real threat of the walkers, and really dealing with what it's like to be living in a time like that. How do people carry on? What sort of traditions do people need to carry on in this world? Good questions and they start answering some of them, and just when we think things will be resolved... sometimes they are and sometimes they're not.My favourite part of the novel was Chapter 16. The main reason I started reading the novels was because of the hope I saw while watching the show (as ironic as that sounds.) It's so hard to have hope in the midst of such crappy circumstances. This had some of the most heart warming moments in the whole graphic novel (if you watch the TV show, it reminded me of a Season 1 moment when Carl and Lori meet Rick.)I hate zombies in general, never have gotten into them at all, never was a genre I wanted to delve into, but The Walking Dead really helped me in a lot of ways to potentially look into other zombie things (I'm still not convinced that I will like them.)I really appreciated the authors/artists who compiled this and the way they put it all together. It fit so well! And you can tell there was a lot of thought put into how they wanted to present the big news, or sometimes make it seem minor when it was actual huge news. Very thoughtfully done.The dialogue in it sometimes was a little bit wooden, but you can't get away from that, it happens in some graphic novels/comics. But, overall very impressed with how intelligent and coherent the story is so far. I look forward to Compendium 3 or wherever this story goes until."}, {"userName": "Lisa (ohthenargles)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7832575-lisa-ohthenargles", "userReview": "It had its ups and downs.

I was really just going to skim this in preparation for Negan's appearance on the television series, but got sucked in! I am so happy that the show doesn't follow the comics as closely as some would prefer. If they were exactly the same we would have no reason to keep reading/watching. The story is always about the people and Kirkman is a genius at finding the situations that show us the most. I will, of course, now have to read volume 3. AGAIN!2014-I find this second compendium focuses more on the threat of other living beings as opposed to the threat of the undead that was the primary focus in the first. Much like The Road by McCarthy, these issues show us how truly frightening other human beings can be. We all want to believe we are compassionate, intrinsically good people, but are we? Really? Those that think about evil in the world we inhabit today can actually act on it in the apocalyptic world with very few consequences. This in turn, forces those of us that do have good intentions to be distrustful and afraid which can lead to our own misdeeds. It\u2019s a vicious circle and once it begins, seems to be a perpetual ouroboros.I\u2019m re-reading these because my mind has become confused between what happened in the books and what happened in the television series. I\u2019m feeling grief all over again at the number of main characters we\u2019ve lost in the books that are still around in the series. I felt their loss as fresh even this second time around! There are other characters that I wish would show up on the page, Dixon, of course, although keeping him off the page is a great way for Kirkman to keep both the book and television audience. Tricky!One thing that never bothered me on first read was just how often the book characters use guns and how infrequently they use tools to kill the undead. I feel that\u2019s an improvement the show made. Noise draws them, why in the world would they continue to use bullets, especially when they can run out, as opposed to hammers, screwdrivers, swords, etc. like they do in the show? It makes so much more sense! I read quite a few of these as issues, later as collections, and now again, as compendiums. I think I am going to wait for the third compendium to come out to read anymore. It\u2019s so satisfying to read so much at once. I no longer want the sips of issues, but rather the gulps of collections. If I\u2019m this greedy today, how greedy (and awful) would I be in a zombie apocalypse?

It is good. Now, I need to decide how far I pursue this story.When I first heard of The Walking Dead, I was excited about the possibility of a never-ending survival story featuring zombies. Now I'm wondering if there wouldn't be better story telling if there was an end in sight. The Walking Dead Compendium 2, while fulfilling my need for a continued experience with familiar and beloved characters, starts to repeat itself. New place to live, new zombie invasion. New place to live, more humans to deal with. After awhile, I can write the story in my head as I go.There's a part of me that wonders if this isn't because the story is meant to be a serial in the old-fashioned sense. I'm reading 48 comics at a sitting, and in this case doing it over a weekend. But that's [i]two years[/i] of comics as they originally were released, and there's a part of me that wonders if that isn't why things are starting to sound repetitive. Would all indefinite comics (and I haven't heard to the contrary that WD has no known end date) read like this, in large collections?The only other lengthy comic collection I've read to compare it to is Y The Last Man, but that was a limited run. Even then, the same problems I had with emotional impact being lessoned because of the formate (for me, for me!) were there. But it wasn't repetitive; it had a direction that WD doesn't seem to have in the second compendium. In all honesty, the first compendium may have only seemed to because, after the first few issues, I was reading the source material of a TV show I'd actually followed farther than the book. I had the show as a marker, and the end of the collection corresponded to what was upcoming on television (oddly enough, I finished Comp. 2 on the night of the season three finale).I don't know. I think I might wait for the next compendium to come out before I return to Rick and his compadres. Kirkman isn't really doing anything that hasn't been done before with zombies, save doing it on a larger (read: longer) scale. It's nice, I like it, and the characters are great. But after a while, a story about rebuilding life after a zombie apocalypse eventually becomes just a story about life, and the ho-hum aspects of life, at that. Still, it beats some of the other crap out there."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7325648-dan", "userReview": "After the events of the first compendium, this one sees Rick and the survivors trying to cope with their losses and then they are invited to become part of The Community, a town which is working to survive the apocalypse. But after so long on the run, can the group ever adjust to normal life again? And is the community as safe as it first appears? My favourite thing about this is that it's a great mixture of zombies and apocalypse surviving. It's mostly about surviving and people trying to rebuild civilisation. After everything that he's been through, Rick especially struggles to return to normality. There's still some awesome zombie action in what is probably the most intense encounter of the series so far but the zombies kind of take a back seat for most of the book, which is a good thing because continuous zombie attacks would get dull after a while. There's some fantastic character development in this book too. Rick is very conflicted, we discover how growing up in this new world is affecting Carl and Glen and Maggie's relationship continues to develop. We re-meet Morgan for the first time since the start of the series and meet lots of new characters including tough-guy Abraham, the conflicted priest Father Gabriel and leader of the community Douglas. They are all believable and interact fabulously, better then the characters of any other comic series. Unlike in a novel we only get to see their feelings from their speech and expressions but the writers still manage to display them brilliantly. This is quite probably my favourite read of the year.

But I forged on, because I couldn't bear to leave the remaining cast of characters in their horrible predicament. And, boy, was I rewarded. This volume generates some of the most striking characters the series has to offer... most prominently Jesus and Abraham. I cannot stress enough how titillating this series is. It keeps you hooked- violently hooked- through every single second of its storyline.

My apologies to Robert Kirkman, but the tv show is a million times better. The show\u2019s characters are more fleshed out and the storylines are much more complex. Most of the time I think it\u2019s a good idea to read the book that a movie or tv show has been adapted from because the book usually gives you a more in depth look at the characters or story, but that does not hold true for The Walking Dead graphic novel. In the comic books, the characters and storylines are the barebones that the tv show does an amazing job of expanding. I don\u2019t care for the graphic novel at all. The art work doesn\u2019t really do anything for me and the characters never really come alive for me. Some of the characters are the same in both mediums (Rick, Maggie, Glenn, Michonne, Carl, etc.) but they aren\u2019t the same. The actors give the characters much more depth and complexity than the comics can. I also don\u2019t have any strong feelings for the comic book characters. I\u2019m rooting for them, but I don\u2019t particularly like them. Andrea (who is still alive in the comic books and portrayed as a very young-looking, freckled-face blonde with a perpetual ponytail) I actively dislike. I can\u2019t say why. I just don\u2019t like her. I don\u2019t like book Maggie either. She\u2019s rather whiny and teary-eyed. When it comes down to it, I guess I really don\u2019t like anyof the book characters. They\u2019re just not as interesting as the tv characters. The storylines are not as interesting or as well-developed as the show. No Terminus in the books. The cannibals are there, but if you blink, you miss them. It\u2019s over very quickly. That\u2019s what\u2019s weird about the books\u2014the stories are very quick. They aren\u2019t complex at all or developed fully. A new conflict or problem develops quickly, there\u2019s a climax, then, boom! it\u2019s over and the characters move on. I kept thinking maybe I skipped a few pages by accident. Last season, the incident with Rick and Jessie\u2019s husband, Pete, took time to develop. The writers teased out the attraction between Rick and Jessie, slowly let the viewers know that Pete beat his wife and you watched Rick get angrier and angrier and more frustrated with the situation until he loses control and violently confronts Pete. This all happens within a few panels in the book. There\u2019s no subtlety, no build-up, nothing. It was rather poorly done. It was interesting to see what specific stories and actions are pulled from the books (sometimes almost exactly except the characters involved may be different) but that\u2019s really the only interesting thing about the books\u2014how they relate to the show.The characters in the book don\u2019t seem to be as smart as their tv counterparts. There is a story that involves the community\u2019s walls being overtaken by walkers. What drew them? Lots of gun fire, which is their primary means of defense. Effective, but noisy. I\u2019m reading this panel thinking\u2026hmmm\u2026this is where Daryl and his kick ass bow would come in handy\u2026So after just barely saving the community from a walker herd by using quieter means (sticks and axes, etc.), what new policy does book Rick implement? Everyone who wants a gun can carry a gun and Andrea (the sharp-shooter for the group) will train people. So a few days later after being invaded by a herd drawn to them by gunfire, Andrea\u2019s out there with a bunch of people doing what? Shooting guns. *Head smack* Darryl and show Rick would be like: WTF? The book suffers a lot from not having Darryl and Carol, my two favorites. Carol\u2019s character did exist in the book, but she was not cool at all. She died; killed herself, I think. Show Carol is way more bad ass than anyone in the comics. There are a lot of soap opera-y panels dealing with relationships\u2014who\u2019s sleeping with whom, who loves whom. It\u2019s just\u2026sigh. Really? Do you people seriously think you need more drama? Walking dead people isn\u2019t enough for you? And one of the things that always irritated me about the show was when some episodes would have these time-outs in which the characters had these long conversations about morals and what kind of person am I turning into yadda yadda yadda. Dale irritated the snot out of me and his comic book character does too. I was glad to see him go. Hershel was different and I liked him as the moral compass of the show. But whenever the show (and the book) turns to explicitly describing the moral conflicts and underlying themes, it\u2019s annoying. We (the readers and viewers) are not idiots. We know this is more than a fight for survival; it\u2019s a fight to stay human\u2014whatever that means in this apocalyptic time. So when the book pounds me over the head with its moral message, I\u2019m irritated. I think that\u2019s where the show gets it from, but luckily the show does it more gracefully and less often than the book. There are quite a few teary-eyed self-doubting oh-woe-is-me-and-this-world Rick scenes in the book; let my eye-rolling commence. Seriously, if you\u2019re not a fan of graphic novels and you enjoy the show, don\u2019t bother with this twenty-pound graphic novel. It does not provide the reader with any new insight into the characters or the stories from the show. The show is much more complex and way more intense. The only reason to look at this compendium (or one of the comic books) is to compare the uncanny likeness of Abraham the ink-drawn character with show Abraham (actor Michael Cudlitz). It\u2019s positively freaky how much they look alike. Also, the characters in the book are allowed to curse. It seems appropriate in this zombie reality that people may get cranky and let a few f-bombs drop now and again. It\u2019s too bad that AMC cannot get over the necessity of the occasional fuck on the show. It\u2019s on late at night and it\u2019s not child-friendly. I\u2019d be a lot more concerned about my child watching a zombie eat a person\u2019s face off than hearing the f-word. I mean, let\u2019s keep this in perspective. But no, this is America, land of the senseless and completely illogical censorship. Female nudity? That\u2019s A-okay. Sex? Also fine. Gratuitous violence? Sure, g\u2019head. Profanity? How dare you! The children might hear it. This is why the Terminus-Rick & Co.-trapped-in-a-boxcar-by-cannibals season finale ended with the lame: \u201cThey\u2019re screwing with the wrong people\u201d instead of the way better \u201cThey\u2019re fucking with the wrong people.\u201d AMC, you\u2019re such hypocrites. I hope this episode on the DVD has the latter version. It\u2019s much more powerful (and linguistically more accurate). Anyway, stepping off my soap box\u2026this compendium does extend past the end of last season\u2019s WD, but not enough to bother reading it. If you\u2019re missing Rick and Co., watch a few of last season\u2019s episodes (one of my favs was the \u201cCarol and Darryl Go Exploring in Downtown Atlanta\u201d ep. Love those two together. Not necessarily in a shippy way. I just think they have excellent chemistry and I like their relationship.). October and the walking dead will be here before you know it. Yippee!"}, {"userName": "Artemy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39811979-artemy", "userReview": "More like 3.5 stars.So, I pretty much hated the first compendium of this series. So why did I go back for the second part? I dunno. Just kinda felt like it. And you know what, I wasn't disappointed. Not really. I mean, yeah, the series still suffers from being too boring, too soap opera-ish, and too wordy at times. Kirkman still isn't very good with character building, and yet he tries it too hard and too often. There was also that pretty famous Carl moment here \u2014 you probably know the one I'm talking about \u2014 which was so ridiculous and impossible to believe, it was infuriating. And that is not to mention that about six out of eight volumes collected here were basically filler \u2014 not all of them bad filler, but still, imagine saying that about any regular comic series. Why did I like this one more than the first book, then?Well, it was more grounded. There weren't as many annoying characters, less ridiculous plots (the Governor, ugh), and the first half of this huge collection was actually really well-paced to my taste. Also, I have actually grown to like most of the characters that survived the ending of the previous compendium. And speaking of which, oh my god, that massive killing off did wonders for this series. All the worst characters kicked the bucket, and the book immediately got so much more readable. Now if only we could get rid of Carl...When reviewing a comic, I usually say something about the artwork. Heh. People don't really do that with The Walking Dead, and that's because Charlie Adlard's artwork is pretty fucking ugly. It is. But hey, the guy is working on schedule, and he gets the job done \u2014the characters are recognisable, the zombies look like zombies \u2014 his work is the very definition of serviceable. Still, every time I picked up my tablet to read another volume (no way am I reading this series in paper format), I was immediately discouraged by the artwork. I have to push through it every time, seriously.So anyway. It was fun. I will take another break from TWD, but it's probably going to be shorter this time \u2014 so maybe early 2017 for the next comp? We'll see. There is still so much of this series left to catch up on, holy crap...By the way, I wrote short reviews for all volumes (except vol 11) collected in this book, if you want, you can find them here:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u30fb Vol. 09: Here We Remain \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u30fb Vol. 10: What We Become \u2605\u2605\u2605\u30fb\u30fb Vol. 12: Life Among Them \u2605\u2605\u2605\u30fb\u30fb Vol. 13: Too Far Gone \u2605\u2605\u2605\u30fb\u30fb Vol. 14: No Way Out \u2605\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb Vol. 15: We Find Ourselves \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u30fb Vol. 16: A Larger World"}, {"userName": "Stephen Arvidson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38585870-stephen-arvidson", "userReview": "By the time readers get around to wading through the one-thousand-plus pages of The Walking Dead: Compendium Two, they\u2019ll see that Robert Kirkman's hard-hitting world of the zombie post-apocalypse has hit its stride, and the ground rules firmly established. The vast majority of mankind has long since been wiped out by an inexplicable pandemic, one that has left hordes of shambling corpses in its wake. Society has crumbled. Supplies are scarce. No one is truly safe\u2014anywhere. People die with heart-breaking frequency\u2026and once decent, law-abiding individuals must now commit heinous acts just to keep breathing. The Walking Dead: Compendium Two, which collects Issues #49-96, is an excellent companion piece for fans of the monumental TV adaptation, though these collected comics make the show look lightweight in terms of sheer brutality. Here, we see how Kirkman has driven Rick Grimes and his ragtag group further into the darkest recesses of humanity. Rick\u2019s tortured son Carl struggles to mature in an unforgiving world wherein innocence is stolen and daily survival remains the unwritten code. In the wake of the deadly prison onslaught, new allies are gained in the form of ex-military type Abraham Ford, Rosita Espinosa, and Eugene Porter (who claims to hold the key to curing the infection and thus restoring order to this bygone world). Survival is paramount as Rick and Co. face new threats, amongst which a small band of desperate humans who\u2019ve decided to forego whatever canned goods still remain and hunt bigger, more convenient game: other humans. Even as the survivors find sanctuary in a lively oasis called the Alexandria Safe-Zone, the unremitting cycle of death continues.While the artwork remains consistently impressive\u2014though it\u2019s still occasionally difficult to distinguish some of the characters at times\u2014the tone dark and gritty, but the awful dialogue and paper-thin characterizations are even worse than that of the previous compendium. Kirkman uses the word \u201cjust\u201d a lot\u2014and I mean A LOT! The narrative takes some familiar turns though not without throwing an occasional fork in the road. Still, this compendium is not without its share of tedious plot rehashing. For instance, on two distinct occasions, the group encounters a new character with a proposition that seems too good to be true, and Rick\u2019s response is to sucker-punch the character, subdue them, and squabble for numerous panels before eventually accepting the newcomer\u2019s offer. There\u2019s also a weak amnesia storyline that only serves to compel Rick and Carl to retread familiar introspective territory. Despite being a good, sprawling adventure, these abovementioned flaws prevent this hefty tome from being a mammoth achievement."}, {"userName": "Brad Carl", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40119265-brad-carl", "userReview": "Compendium 2 is just as intriguing and fun to read as the first one.

I am in love with the story, in love with the characters, and I hate knowing there is a third compendium in the future cause I wanna read it NOW! Although this was over 2000+ pages by the end of Compendium 2, and 96 volumes worth of story I still wanted more. I\u2019ve read a couple of reviews where people have complained about the story getting repetitive in Book 2, but in my opinion, it has not seemed that way for me. These people are living in dangerous times, so it\u2019s only natural that they are going to be nomadic people every time they outwear a place due to danger or walkers. It\u2019s progression in the story that they find new communities. The more graphic novels I read, the more I am learning to appreciate this medium. I have read some exceptional stories in this format and this one was no exception. This format captures the darkness of the story but also has torn at my heart when I see the pain and suffering the characters have gone through. This may not be for everyone, but for me it\u2019s a story with characters that will long live in my heart."}, {"userName": "J", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8995908-j", "userReview": "I thought this was better than the first compendium, or at least I found it more enjoyable. I still feel like none of the supporting characters have a distinct voice but at least most of the catch-phrases are gone. Except for \"man\" and EVERYone says that. All the time. There's a lot of pointless exposition. Rick does something or something happens to him and he immediately has to recount what we just saw to another character for no reason. There is a revolving door of characters who act as Ricks confidant for the sole purpose of giving him someone to whine to without taking time to develop those relationships first. Also, if you can't tell a character apart by their mustache, you probably don't need to know who they are. This is a really good story that suffers from mediocre dialogue and characterization so the joke is really on me because I can't help but want to keep reading to see how it's all going to turn out even if I am annoyed the whole time."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5126489-lisa", "userReview": "What can I say other than WOW!

For somebody going from the show to the books or vice versa, there really aren't spoilers. The weird thing for me is seeing Carl stay a little boy in the book, but on the show the actor has become a teenager. And I have to say I kind of like the Rick in the book more than the one on the show. Rick in the book doesn't mess around. He does things that make my jaw drop.
