Like, just imagine a really calm and encouraging book talking about personality disorders and other psychological phenomena and giving lots of examples and case studies, but READ BY A GAME SHOW HOST. That is what this audiobook is like. So seriously, listen to it, because there are parts that are unintentionally laugh-out-loud funny. When he does women's voices it's the BEST. Or when he says things like \"Bob had a secret gambling addiction\" way, way too enthusiastically.But content-wise it's great, too. It's really sad that there even needs to BE a book about this. But there does. Naive idiots like me need it to at least SPOT the red flags so we can smartly decide how to interact with narcissists / sociopaths / victim-blamers and all the rest, instead of just being willy-nilly about it to our own doom. I hope that most of you wouldn't need to read this, and would be like \"Uh, duh. Obvious. Why are you telling me this?\" if you do read it. But for the rest of us, you can benefit from hearing things named and called out so that you can overcome them, be kind to yourself, be forgiving, and get through life with less damage to yourself and your family."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4113059-patricia", "userReview": "Evil is defined in the Bible as anything that is harmful, or not beneficial, to your spiritual growth. Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend apply this principle to relationships, with the challenge to evaluate yourself and your relationships with other people. God made people to be dependent on each other for love, encouragement, and support. A healthy relationship always involves honesty, acceptance, wise counsel, and confrontation. All of these are necessary for growth. The quality of your relationship with people is an indicator of your spiritual growth. If the friendships in your life are not giving you the support and honesty you need, they are not helping you: they are not safe. Unsafe people don't see their problems, so they don't change. If you are too afraid to tell the truth to others, you will be taken advantage of, manipulated, and ultimately hurt. If someone is unwilling to face up to their part in things, you can't have reconciliation. Just as God has forgiven and restored us, we should desire restoration in our own relationships. Every healthy relationship is founded in mutual honesty and love. These relationships will be satisfying.

As a pastor I want people to feel safe when they talk with me and at times share intimate details of their lives with me. I picked this book up because I was serving a church where there seemed to be a mistrust of pastors from the time I arrived. I was a little taken back by that since everywhere else I had served people tended to trust me from the time I arrived and that trust would even deepen as we developed relationships and learned to be vulnerable with one another. I was looking to understand why people felt unsafe and to help them know that I was a safe person in their life. What I discovered that there had been at least 3 pastors that had inappropriate relationships while serving this church and one of them ran off with two different women within a few weeks of one another. I also found that they suspected that at least one pastor had used funds inappropriately as well. They had reason not to trust and I wanted to rebuild that trust so I bought a book on safe people to make sure I was one of them. Before I began to read the book two men in my life that thought I could trust and be vulnerable with betrayed that trust and used it to create further harm for me and my family. I had trusted them because of the position that held and one that I had know for more than a decade I thought of as a friend. I obviously needed to learn about who to trust and how to develop better boundaries in my life. Who better to turn to than Cloud and Townsend, the experts on boundaries. They did not disappoint. What I have discovered it that I need to listen more carefully about what other people are telling me about someone and their experience with them. Looking back I can see a pattern in many of the relationships that have caused me pain that I could of avoided if I had been paying more attention to the traits these people exhibited not just with me but many others. Safe People will help you better evaluate your relationships and how to see when someone can't be expected to be a safe person for you to share with. I also learned a number of things about myself that may have made other people feel unsafe with me and I think I will be a better spouse, parent, pastor and friend because of what I have learned. Everything I read I tend to look for myself in it so that I can grow and become a better person. I tend to believe that the majority of relationships are worth the investment to try and make them better and the final chapter challenges us to do exactly that. It takes a few pages to help us understand when to continue investing in a relationship and when we should walk away and be willing to give it up. The truth is that both come with costs. I recommend this book to anyone that wants better relationships but to those especially that have been hurt by people they thought they could trust. It will help to develop the courage to try again if you are willing to take the risk and experience the rewards."}, {"userName": "Erika", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6840223-erika", "userReview": "The subtitle of Safe People is exactly what this book is about: finding good people for all types of relationships. Part One explains what a \"unsafe\" person is by identifying personal and interpersonal traits. These individuals are typically categorized as abandoners, critics, or irresponsibles. Unsafe people do the following: believe they \"have it all together\" instead of admitting weaknesses; go on the defensive instead of accepting feedback; act self-righteously instead of humbly; apologize instead of changing their behavior; avoid working on problems instead of dealing with them; demand trust instead of earning it; believe in their own perfection instead of admitting faults; blame others instead of taking responsibility; lie instead of telling the truth; are stagnant instead of growing (related to self-awareness); avoid closeness instead of connecting; are only concerned with \"I\" instead of \"we\"; resist freedom instead of encouraging it; flatter instead of confronting others; condemn instead of forgiving others; stay in a parent/child role instead of relating as equals; become unstable over time instead of remaining consistent; are a negative influence on others; and gossip instead of keeping secrets. (So yeah...watch out for those people...) All is not lost though--Part One also explains how people lose their \"safety\", which leads to self-awareness and change. Part Two describes if and how one may actually attract unsafe people or fall into unsafe relationships. Just when it appears that hope is merely a distant echo, Part Three clarifies what a \"safe\" person is, how to be one, how to find one, and when to move on. Despite the religious overtones, this book was very informative, interesting, and provocative."}, {"userName": "Evan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4652357-evan", "userReview": "Easily retitled \"Safe vs. Unsafe People\", while reading this book, I had the eery feeling that someone had videotaped my relationship and took notes...because the book identified the subtle unhealthy attributes of my (now Ex) spouse in great detail one bullet point to the next, and I came to view her (often unexplainable) behavior in a completely new way. Reading this was a \"light bulb moment\" in our separation, and one hopes a guiding light for the next relationship.The book identifies the qualities of unsafe people even better than those safe to have relationships with - whose qualities seem rather common sense.While the book comes somewhat from a Christian/Biblical perspective, a non-believer can read around the bible quotes and get a mountain of knowledge from this tiny book.While some people who are problematic to have relationships with are obvious; 1) \"I'm never responsible for anything and am always the victim of life/others\" and 2) \"The world revolves around me...hey listen up\", other Unsafe people are hard to spot! This book also details another category 3) I'm perfect, cannot accept any proof I'm not, and the world had better change itself to be perfect for me - or else - because that's what I deserve! (unfortunately such people are close to perfect on paper/reality, utterly responsible and hardworking, but these beliefs make them impossible to live with).Rather than generally categorizing, it specifically analyzes the actions and thoughts of those safe and unsafe people so you can identify them generally by their actions rather than labels. Examples \"Safe people are ever changing, unsafe people are stagnant and unwilling to try/learn new things\" \"Safe people are spiritual, unsafe people are overly religious\" \"Safe people treat others as near equals, unsafe people treat others as children who need their instruction\", \"unsafe people seek forgiveness, safe people then REPENT\", etc."}, {"userName": "Catherine Richmond", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/275437-catherine-richmond", "userReview": "This would be great for a small group with a professional facilitator.

Who we are and what we do are very, very related\" (54).\"If you have a pattern of bad relationships, it may not be the other person's fault but actually be a sign of your own spiritual immaturity\" (108).\"The perfectionist tries to live in the land of ideals.... He is in bondage to a demand that says, 'If you do it right, you'll be loved.' ...the antidote to perfectionism isn't being good -- it's being loved\" (132-4).\"What many Christians do not understand is that relating to each other is a spiritual activity.... We need to include in our evaluation of our spiritual lives the question, 'How am I doing with other people? How are my relationships going?'\" (148).\"...one of the major pieces to healing any emotional disorder is grief\" (152).\"It is only as we relate intimately to others in the body of Christ that we find out how unloving we can actually be.... If we never have close relationships, we can be under the delusion that we really are loving.

They also both hold PhDs, AND are strongly entrenched in the American Christian life philosophies.If you, also, are strongly entrenched in the American Christian lifestyle, this would be an excellent read for you. If you are are NOT, especially if you still carry trauma from being involved in this lifestyle previously (*raises hand*) you may have to tiptoe through the God-talk in order to avoid triggering issues.Even with that caveat, this books has many, many excellent nuggets and insights in it. Here are some bits that resonated with me: \"Unsafe people only apologize instead of changing their behavior.\" Or the concept of \"merger wishes\" relationships: \"When someone else possesses a trait that we don't have, we are inclined to blur our identity with with theirs in order to help us feel better about ourselves and to gain access to that trait.\" Or the tendency, when our boundaries are weak, to go for all or nothing: \"...boundaryless people tend to isolate as their only limit. Often, people with weak boundaries will give in repeatedly to some irresponsible or demanding person. Then, out of the blue, they'll pack up and leave the relationship with no warning.\"We DON'T have to be with unsafe people; nor can nor should we, trust our church or social club to screen people for us. That was my biggest take-away from this book, recognizing my own tendency/wish to think that in XYZ group, everyone is \"safe\" for me. Just ain't so. Because of MY life experiences, traits, and personality, Person A may be unsafe for me, but absolutely safe for YOU, and vice versa. As adults, we each need to figure out how to sort out and separate those who are safe and unsafe for us, PERSONALLY. We can't count on others to do it for us, anymore than we can count on others to exercise for us.Some of the traits of safe people, according to this book, include: \"Someone who gives me an opportunity to grow; someone I can be myself around; Someone who allows me to be on the outside what I am on the indie; someone whose life touches mine and leaves me better for it,\" and much more.I do highly recommend this book, and am only deducting a star because of the triggering issues it may present to some readers."}, {"userName": "Lori L (She Treads Softly) ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4592109-lori-l-she-treads-softly", "userReview": "Safe People: How to Find Relationships That Are Good for You and Avoid Those That Aren't by Henry Cloud and John Townsend deals with the problem of character discernment.

They are accepting, honest, and present, and they help us bear good fruit in our lives (pg. 11).\" The goal of Safe People is two fold. First, it will help us find and recognize safe and unsafe people. Second, it will also help us recognize areas in our lives where we are unsafe and help us become a safe person.The book is divided up into three sections. In the introduction it says:\"In Part 1, 'Unsafe People,' you'll learn who unsafe people are and the twenty identifying traits of unsafe people (chapters 1-4).In Part 2, 'Do I Attract Unsafe People?' you'll get a picture of the origin of the problem: why you currently choose the wrong people, and how to repair this problem (chapters 5-8).In Part 3, 'Safe People,' you will learn more about what safe people are and why you need them. You will also receive practical help on successfully meeting and relating to safe people. We designed this book to help you look both outside and inside yourself. (pg. 12)\"If you are open to honestly examining yourself, your relationships and your actions, Safe People will definitely give you a greater understanding of your role in interpersonal relationships. It is a Christian faith-based book. I thought it was very convicting to examine the relationships I have and the role I take in them. Along with Cloud and Townsend's book Boundaries, it has the potential to be a powerful tool, especially for a Christian's recovery from various problems.

For example, they\u2019d use the pronoun \u201cshe\u201d when describing a person in an abusive relationship or \u201che\u201d when talking about someone with anger problems without introducing a fake scenario to describe the situation.I\u2019d recommend it to those who have trouble keeping relationships or have hundreds of \u201cfriends\u201d but don\u2019t have many close ones.
