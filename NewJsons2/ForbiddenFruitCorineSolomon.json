This is a novella and should not be read as a standalone or until Shady Lady is read.I have a mixed relationship with the Corinne Solomon series. I enjoy and appreciate Ann Aguirre\u2019s writing style. Few authors write characters they way she does. Aguirre includes characters not usually written about by other authors and she develops these characters with intense internal conflict. Importantly, the world building is solid and intricate. Ms. Aguirre crafts a great story, unlike most urban fantasy series \u2014 she fills them with interesting characters. This is a darker, grittier and character focused series. My issues with this series is my personal annoyance with the main character; and also, that in the first book the storyline dragged toward the end. My second complaint was not an issue in books 2 and 3, Aguirre wrote a damned good story in both 2 and 3. Basically with every book in this series I am a little more into the series and definitely more hooked.Forbidden fruit is a novella told from the point of view of Shannon Cheney introduced in Hell Fire. The novella centers around Shannon and Jesse. I really liked this story and would love to read more from Shannon\u2019s point of view and about Jesse.Forbidden Fruit is a sexy and sweet novella. The scaries that exist in the world of Corinne Solomon exist in this world and are after Shannon \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t know it. This novella made me want to get back into Corinne Solomon and read Devil\u2019s Punch \u2026. very soon. Readers and fans of this series will want to read Forbidden Fruit because it is fun and because it ties up some story lines from Shady Lady. Conflicted readers of this series (like me \u2026) will want to read Forbidden Fruit because it will recharge you and convince you that you need to finish the series.\n  To read this review and more like it check out Bad Ass Book Reviews"}, {"userName": "Feminista", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5716741-feminista", "userReview": "Forbidden Fruit = a girl barely out of high school and an older man..."}, {"userName": "Yolanda Sfetsos", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4724592-yolanda-sfetsos", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the first three Corine Solomon books, so now that I'm catching up on a bunch of series books, I thought I'd start with this novella...And really, I think I would've been better off skipping it. I was interested because of the amnesia spell thing, but IMO it just didn't come together.While I love Corine's voice, Shannon's didn't work for me. She was a little annoying, and I just couldn't warm to her. The same goes for Jesse. I liked him in Corine's books but here, not so much. :/ And both of them together? I don't know... I just didn't buy their instant connection/attraction--especially his. It has nothing to do with the age difference, and everything to do with the actual characters.The writing was nice and is actually what kept me reading to the very end, but it wasn't enough to make me love it.

It\u2019s a must-read for fans! This novella follows Shannon Cheney, Corine\u2019s best friend at the age of nineteen and how she and sexy cop Jesse Saldana get together. Let me tell you, this novella hit all the right buttons for me. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s romantic, it\u2019s sexy and it\u2019s action-packed. FORBIDDEN FRUIT just may be one of my favorite novellas I\u2019ve read this year.Simply put, Shan rocks. She has the unique ability to communicate with the dead through a radio. However, she\u2019s missing some of her memories as well. All this sounds very suspicious but she realizes that Jesse has this weird amnesia as well. As they try to find out what happened to them, the plot thickens as Shan is being stalked and/or attacked by crazies. For its short length, I really loved seeing the supernatural elements in it.But for me, it was the romance between Jesse and Shan that made this book so great. Their banter is some of the best I\u2019ve read in a long time. Shan is shamelessly flirty with the hot cop, but because of the age difference, Jesse is keeping his hands to himself. That is, until he can\u2019t resist her any longer. Shan just has a way of getting under Jesse\u2019s skin and their chemistry is like fireworks. Kudos to Ann Agguire for this wonderfully crafted romance. She really does it right!After devouring this novella, I realized that I would love to read more about Jesse and Shan at this stage. Outrageously fun and sexually mature, Shan\u2019s nineteen year old character really jumped out from the pages leaping straight into my heart.

She ends up in the protective custody of one Jesse Saldana, an officer who helps her along her journey and protects her when danger comes knocking at her door, and there's quite a few encounters to be had in this story.It may be that I'm coming into this story with no knowledge of the characters or respective series, but I thought this was only okay. The instalove factor is heavy and I'll admit I wasn't convinced of the attraction between these two characters or the overarching stakes of this brief read. I thought Shan's (Shannon) character was brash and overbearing, and while I like assertive characters who have witty banter and dialogue within supernatural circumstances, I thought Shan's character was forced and overmuch. Jesse's character was okay, and I liked some of his one-liners, but it wasn't enough to vet out the situation even in this brief read. I thought Shan acted clueless in her encounters far too easily, and it made her character non-endearing for things that she should've recognized were bad ideas or odd things to say in the heat of the moment, especially when she was in peril. It wasn't my cuppa reading, and I've read better novellas from Aguirre (\"Thistle and Thorn\" from the \"Til' The World Ends\" anthology being one), but I wouldn't be opposed out of curiosity just to see what series this is from, and maybe have better luck in the reads there.Overall score: 2/5Note: I received this as an ARC from NetGalley, from the publisher."}, {"userName": "Paris", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4806520-paris", "userReview": "I love Shannon Cheney. She\u2019s an absolutely fun and hilarious character, who isn\u2019t perfect, but knows what and who she is. She\u2019s not ashamed of the fact that she used make-up as an armor, she acknowledges it and notes that it makes her stronger, less vulnerable to wear it. Since she was introduced in the Corine Solomon series, I\u2019ve been a huge fan and when Ann Aguirre mentioned she was writing a novella from Shannon\u2019s POV, I was super excited.This novella definitely didn\u2019t disappoint. It was great seeing the world from Shannon\u2019s POV and getting to know her a little better. I especially loved her and Jesse and the evolution of their relationship. Their chemistry is super hot, more so than Jesse\u2019s chemistry with Corine had ever been. Shannon says the most hilarious, outrageous things to him in both awkward flirtation and seriously hot innuendos. I think I would enjoy a book filled with just them bantering back and forth before getting to lots and lots of the really good stuff. No other plot would be needed.In the back of Forbidden Fruit, Ann offers up the possibility of more Shannon and Jesse goodness that would take place after Agave Kiss. All I can say to that is YES PLEASE!! I definitely want to see more of them and although I\u2019ll take it any way I can get it, I would like to put a vote in for a full length novel and not just a novella. Thanks Ann for giving me something I didn\u2019t realize how badly I wanted until you wrote it for us. And I know that Shannon already has a BFF in Corine, I\u2019d definitely like to volunteer for the job is she\u2019s taking applications for back-up BFFs."}, {"userName": "All Things Urban Fantasy", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2732683-all-things-urban-fantasy", "userReview": "I have come to treasure novellas that offer a glimpse of familiar characters between the books. I\u2019m less excited when these glimpses give me a behind the scenes of secondary characters. The May/ December romance between Shannon and Jesse piqued my curiosity enough to be excited for FORBIDDEN FRUIT, and my excitement is not mislaid.Mentioning the age difference between the hero and heroine in this book is important, because a reader\u2019s feelings towards this dynamic will most likely make or break their enjoyment of the story. Anyone who picks up this book icked out about a 19 year-old woman dating a guy ten years her senior isn\u2019t going to find anything to change their mind, not in this story anyway. Shannon is a hilarious narrator, and I enjoyed this peek through her eyes. She is struggling with blank spots in her memory, though, which makes it hard to sell her relationship with Jesse based on this novella alone. For those of us who know the backstory, however, FORBIDDEN FRUIT offers a tantalizing glimpse behind the scenes. While I didn\u2019t enjoy reading Jesse\u2019s issues all over again (as a \u201crecycled\u201d romantic interest he\u2019s already had his share of the spot light), knowing that this time around promises a happily-ever-after made it worthwhile.Shannon brings out a sexy side of Jesse that I\u2019ve never seen before and getting a glimpse of their relationship dynamic was thoroughly entertaining. For those looking for a little taste of the Corine Solomon world to tide them over, FORBIDDEN FRUITis a delicious treat well worth a read.Sexual Content: Sex scenes."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3208743-kristin", "userReview": "Writing: 4Story: 2Satisfaction: 2This is NOT a complete stand-alone story. I picked this up because I was interested in reading one of Ann Aguirre's works but sadly this is a short novella that comes between books 3 and 4 of another series and doesn't hold a complete story on its own. Problems are introduced that are never fleshed out and never concluded and it feels like it was written to be a larger book that just got chopped off in the middle. The main character is 19-year old, sexually mature Shannon who can summon the dead with a radio. She can't remember the past but she knows that the sexy cop Jesse Saldana (the full name because she repeats it constantly) scooped her out of it, though he doesn't remember most of it either. Shannon is written with an entertaining first person voice, though she makes a lot of modern pop references that will date this novella for anyone who reads it later. I enjoyed her perspective though her obsession with Jesse, an empath who can both feel and project emotions, borders on obsessive and his obsession with her seems weirdly mature for a 25 year old cop who seems to be mature in other aspects of his life. I wish this novella had wrapped up in some way. Even some smallish conclusion would have been satisfactory but it's definitely not a story on its own.

I really enjoyed the first two Corine Solomon novels, loved reading about Mexico, enjoyed Corine and Chance, Chuch and Eva. Never really connected with Shannon. And Jesse didn't have any flaws, so he was a bit boring.After those first two books, the series went downhill. It jumped the shark. I don't mind when authors write series-changing plots, but I do have an issue when I don't like the new direction.Still, I couldn't resist picking up Forbidden Fruit from NetGalley. And it's okay. Not great, but not bad. Admittedly it's more paranormal romance than urban fantasy, so that probably made me like it less. Not that I'm against romance per se, but I am when the characters become less interesting once they hook up. And before they hook up, Shannon sexually harasses Jesse a lot, but because this is a romance, supposedly us readers aren't supposed to have a problem with it."}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122617-tammy", "userReview": "If you've read Ann Aguirre's Corine Solomon series then you've met Shannon and Jesse.

As a result, I was a little nervous starting my experience with the series off with a novella that takes place after the first few books in the series, but I needn\u2019t have worried. While I think I would have benefited from having read the series prior to this novella, I still really enjoyed it, and it made me want to start the series sooner rather than later.Shannon Cheney can communicate with the dead through the use of an antique radio. This doesn\u2019t really help her pay the bills though, as the world is unaware of the existence of the Gifted. So, she\u2019s currently having to pay the bills by working at the Pretzel Pirate in the mall, which is not anyone\u2019s idea of a dream job. On top of that, she\u2019s suffering from a severe case of memory loss. She has no idea what events led her here, and has no idea how to go about figuring out what happened. The only good thing in her life right now is cop Jesse Saldana, a man she is determined to seduce. As they attempt to figure out what caused the memory loss, their feelings for each other grow, and danger looms in the form of demonic attacks. Will they survive long enough to make their feelings known to each other?I really enjoyed having Shannon as the narrator. She was sassy and funny, and her actions and voice seemed to fit my idea of a 19-year-old Goth girl. I had a little bit harder time connecting to Jesse, probably because we don\u2019t get to see anything from his point of view since the novella has first person narration. That being said, he is extremely caring and supportive of Shannon and doesn\u2019t treat her like she\u2019s helpless. What more can you ask for in a hero?Not having read previous books in the Corine Solomon series, I\u2019m not sure if readers know what caused the memory loss, but my curiosity was definitely peaked. I would have preferred it if we could have gotten some answers, but I\u2019m guessing the answers can be found in full-length books from the series. If Ann Aguirre\u2019s purpose was to bring new readers to the Corine Solomon series, she definitely succeeded with me. This was a fast-paced, entertaining read that never had a dull moment. I\u2019ll definitely be starting the series soon!Notable Scene:I stumble back a few steps and topple a display between us. The shattering glass slows her down long enough for me to pop open my backpack. Dodging between display racks, I weave away from her.

Corinne Solomon doesn't actually appear, so it seems to be more of a spin-off than a continuation, or an infill. I don't know whether these two characters are staples of the series or not. It's pretty obvious there's something strange going on. Shannon communicates with the dead via an antique radio and Jesse is a cop who's looking after her as she resettles in Laredo. There's a hole in her memories, apparently the result of some sort of spell and Jesse, an empath as well as a cop - has the same gap in his knowledge. There are demons after Shann, buit we don't really find out why. I suspect that wuill be revealed in other books in the series. Basically this is the story of how two people's relationship changes.
