Not me. The story revolves around Hanna Casey. After separating from her cheating husband, Hanna, in her early fifties, ends up living with her mother on the outskirts of a town in Ireland where she grew up. Her daughter Jazz has a job with an airline company and spends her time flying around the world, coming back every now and then to visit her mother and grandmother or at other times visiting her father in London. Hanna has a job as librarian in the Finfarran Peninsula community. This is a far cry from the lifestyle she lived while married to Malcolm. But given the shortage of jobs in the area, she knows she is lucky to have a job at all. As she drives her mobile library van around the area, Hanna tries to keep herself aloof from the people and even those she works with at the library, like Conor. But then events conspire to change her way of looking at life and of the people around her.This is a charming, feel good story. The setting was stunning and the characters were interesting. Even though she can be prickly, I felt sorry for Hanna. Her mother Mary Casey is an aggravating character. No wonder Hanna could not contemplate continuing to live with her and decides to renovate the old house left to her by her great aunt Maggie. Some of Hanna\u2019s interactions with Fury, the builder, are classic. There is a hint of romance in the novel, but it is not the main focus. Basically this is a book about relationships, community and working together. I enjoyed this charming read that leaves the reader feeling in a good place."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/386073-laurie", "userReview": "This was a bit hard to get into and rather slow-going at times; a lot of characters to keep track of and not all of them were fun to spend time with. I was especially annoyed that the main character, a trained librarian, was opposed to providing her community with the most basic of library programming and services -- she was against book clubs, for heaven's sake. No wonder her library was threatened with closing. Maybe libraries are different in Ireland than they are here in the U.S., but her attitude was baffling to me as a librarian.

It sounds like a lovely community. The ending is okay as all goes well, but I feel like there are some few loose ends that need to be tied. I guess there will be a sequel to this. I can\u2019t seem to connect to Hanna most of the time and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of the age. There are also a lot of characters that it got so confusing to follow who is who. It started painfully slow for my liking that I find myself skimming some pages because it fails to catch my interest. The conflict came later on in which I feel like a good quarter of the book can be shed off.It is well-written, though, and the main reason that I keep reading. That and the second half of the book is so much better that I managed to get through it until the end. From the numerous characters, there are some whom I enjoyed reading than the others. Sister Michael, a nun in the convent, and Fury, the carpenter who\u2019s fixing Hanna\u2019s cottage, both of them helped Hanna save the library and the community. There\u2019s a hint of romance, too, which is not really the focus of the story, which I like. I also love how everyone banded together to save not only the library but the whole community. With all that, I\u2019d say it is still a good read overall. It just needs the kind of reader who will enjoy not only the writing style but also the lovely setting in Ireland."}, {"userName": "Kate Olson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13650342-kate-olson", "userReview": "Oh, what an absolutely wonderful book for every book lover on earth! I adored this story of a public library, a woman starting over, family, friends and community set in rural Ireland. The setting is fabulous, the people make my heart happy and the storyline of a librarian saving a library makes this school librarian jump for joy. Thanks a million to the publisher for sending me a complimentary review copy of this title! Now, if all of that makes me so happy, just IMAGINE how excited I was to find out that this is actually the first book in a series that was originally published in Ireland and is just now coming to the US from Harper Perennial! AND, the next 2 books in the series are available to buy in the US through Book Depository, so of course I ordered them immediately and can now binge read them the moment they arrive! YAY! The US cover is VERY different from the Irish covers ~ the Irish covers are very much in the \"English cozy\" style with illustrations and curly cutesy font. Both are great, but I do think this photographic cover will do amazingly well here in the states!"}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8026056-hannah", "userReview": "Putting this one down early.

All opinions are my own!I've been feeling stuck when browsing my shelves for my next read, so I've gravitated towards books that are more inside my reading comfort zone. The Library at the Edge of the World was a perfect choice for me this month as I navigate this season of life & reading. As the title suggests, this is a book for book lovers, but also a book for those feeling adrift in their own communities and are searching for belonging.The Library at the Edge of the World follows a middle-aged woman named Hanna Casey. While at first glance, Hanna's life may seem picturesque -- a local job as head librarian in her hometown on the gorgeous cliffs of Ireland -- Hanna's life is a bit of a mess. She lives with her aging mother, is always missing her own teenage daughter while she's out exploring the globe, and resents her ex-husband for ruining the life she had built before their divorce. Hanna hadn't planned to live in her struggling hometown of Finfarran -- but when she found her husband in bed with a family friend, thus revealing a twenty-year affair, Hanna uprooted her socialite London life to recuperate in the safety of her childhood home. Now, she's tired of her reserved life and wants a fresh start. An inheritance in the form of a dilapidated cottage presents Hanna with an opportunity to create the home that she's desperately in need of, and gives her an opportunity to put down roots in a community that she's held at arms length.While the premise of this book is nothing new -- a broken relationship, the need to start over, and a project for the main character to use as therapy -- I really enjoyed reading this story. I loved the unfamiliar setting, and found myself pining for a trip to Ireland to see the gorgeous views that are described throughout. I also liked the rhythm of this story. It was a slower read for me, and more gentle than many of the books I've read lately. I liked rooting Hanna on as she found her footing and gained independence from her former life, and I found myself cheering on her community too. This novel falls into a category previously defined as \"chick lit\" but now more often referred to as \"women's fiction\" and although I sometimes scoff at that labeling for obvious reasons, I'm finding myself more open to reading similar books this year! There are two other books taking place in the same location and with recurring characters, so if you pick up the first and like me, find yourself a new fan of Felicity Hayes-McCoy, then make sure to pick up the others too!"}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "Delightful read with many endearing moments. I found the characters nicely rounded and the dialogue fully believable. There is so much growth in the main character and the community overall, from the story's onset to its conclusion, it made for a satisfying, believable tale. And of course, the topic of libraries being on budget chopping blocks is quite timely. The downside, which is really minor quibbles: at times the flow seemed to meander and the middle bogged down just a wee bit and lost a sliver of spunk. Overall, I thought it a rather enjoyable read - in the class of lighter faire of noteworthy integrity; less brassy than chick-lit but far from literary, landing somewhere in the middle. And not too heavy with expletives or unsavory content. A fun, weekend read to lift one's spirits in the throes of winter's deepfreeze or a summertime broiler.3.5 Rounded up . . .

Hanna currently lives at home with her mother and although she appreciates her, she knows it's time to find her own place. Her great-aunt has left her a run-down cottage on the coast and she decides now is the time to restore it, but it's going to be a big job.

As an avid reader my reading choices were also influenced, and I read everything I could find by Marian Keyes and Maeve Binchy (20 years ago chick lit was HUGE).Fast forward to 2017. I received an ARC of The Library at the Edge of the World (thanks Netgalley) and hoped it would bring back some of that old Irish magic. It did.I found the descriptions of the house on the hill so evocative. I actually had a dream while reading the book about having a little cabin of my own somewhere. The characters in the book were outspoken and kind, and life in and around the village seemed charming, despite the challenges. Sometimes I felt that there were too many details about the council's workings but I realize that they were integral to the plot.I thought this was an excellent feel good story of contemporary life in a small Irish village which is threatened by high level government decisions. This book is perfect for readers who want the same slice of Irish life feeling as Maeve Binchy and Marian Keyes but with less of a romance angle and more of a generic where is my life going angle."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1644222-stephanie", "userReview": "It was a bit predictable, but I didn't mind.

The story is set in the fictional \"Finfarra Peninsula\" in the rural west of Ireland, and could easily have been the Dingle Peninsula where my husband's huge extended family lives. What fun! The bold adventure proved more poignant and instructional than light-hearted, however: initially I bristled at the stereoptypical depiction of a stern, judgmental librarian who barely tolerates her work, and local Irish politics can be as tedious as ours. But things picked up pleasantly when the library was threatened and townsfolk banded together to try to help. It wasn't quite the American trope of \"Let's put on a show and save the day!\" but a more restrained, quirkily Irish variation. The Irish way with words is on full display here (\"Ah Holy God Almighty, that I reared an eejit! You're a fool and the whole world knows it!\" grumbles her mother, and the librarian consoles herself \"It wasn't that the world and his wife were talking about her.\" Later, when a proper fight is required she considers \"Battles aren't won by going at things like a class of a bull at a gate,\" and goes about organizing her revolution with some subtlety.) I liked the book, relished a realistic visit to a favorite place, and marveled again at the clear differences in temperament between many Americans and the Irish.It's a good season for lovers of books and small-town libraries, with American Sue Halpern's \"Summer Hours at the Robbers Library\" coming out later this month."}, {"userName": "Karina", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62428250-karina", "userReview": "Brought book on vacation thinking it would be a good poolside book.

There's a new Irish author in print and she's taken the best of both these others and added some style and depth of her own to create a really interesting, authentic read.Divorcee Hanna Casey is the head librarian back in her old home town of Lissbeg, Ireland, but after five years, she is feeling restless, unfulfilled and tired of living with her mother. Hanna's daughter, Jazz, is now an adult and working as a flight attendant with her own life to lead. After an abortive attempt to get her former English husband to finance a small home of her own, Hanna reluctantly considers remodeling an old, broken down shanty on a sea-front lot bequeathed to her long ago by a great-aunt. The builder who basically engages himself on her behalf, is known around the area as being a law unto himself and drives her crazy because he won't be pinned down by minor details like quotes for the work, schedules, or even by cell-phone! To add to the drama, the Lissbeg Library is under the threat of closure by the County Council's new budget and it looks like her job (which admittedly, she doesn't love, but still depends on) will soon come to an untimely end. She joins forces with her lively assistant, Conor, a hidden-from-the-world nun and an unlikely crew of locals who enthusiastically undertake to \"fight city hall,\" as it were.

Hanna left her long term husband Malcolm (and his money) after she found him in bed with another woman.Lissberg is the town that time forgot, but Hanna is fortunate to find a job in the small Lissberg library, which is in close proximity to an old convent where two elderly nuns reside. She is assisted on a part time basis by Conor McCarthy, whose goal is to become a librarian. The Lissberg library is under the control of the County Library in Carrick and Tim Slattery, the County librarian.Hanna finds the job dull, but two days a week she drives the mobile library to more remote locations, providing books and conversation to people who otherwise would not have access to a library. Although extremely reserved, Hanna enjoys this particular part of her job.At the age of 12, Hanna had inherited a cottage from her reclusive Aunt Maggie. When Hanna returns to Ireland the cottage is ramshackle and unlivable. Hanna\u2019s life with her mother is tense and Hanna decides to take a loan and renovate the deteriorating cottage.

Despite her reserve, Hanna finds herself and her library at the center of a resistance movement, seemingly initiated by one of the elderly nuns in the convent. And somehow, along the way, Hanna finds romance. I will not give away the ending, which has a few twists and turns.The novel is enjoyable and sweet. Along with issues of development and the importance of community, the book looks at family relationships, politics, power, deceit and loyalty.

This did not influence the opinions of my review in any way.I recently did a writing exercise in preparation for NaNoWriMo where we listed things we like to see in books. Mine included a small town setting, strong female characters, a central meeting place, and an underdog. All those wonderful aspects are part of The Library At The Edge Of The World, by Felicity Hayes-McCoy. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and left me with a massive desire to visit Ireland in the future.What I Liked:Strong Female Character:Hanna Casey once had dreams of being an art librarian in London. But after her marriage and high-flying lifestyle crumbles, she must return home to Ireland and live with her shrew of a mother. She finds employment at the local library, a big step down, but she is somewhat content there.I love how Hanna regained her self-worth by renovating an old home. Through her builder, she learns to compromise and to realize that accepting help from others doesn't make you weak.Once she realizes the county plans to consolidate services (and close the library), she spearheads an effort to mobilize the whole village to act.Small Town Setting:While the little peninsula of Finfarran is fictional, the book's vivid descriptions and colorful characters created a living place. There are beautiful beaches with stunning coastlines. Quaint farms, and family-run bed and breakfast inns, all struggling in an economy that is fading. They see their economy, which is mostly tourism, slowly slipping away as wealthy businessmen guide lucrative government contracts towards larger towns. If they don't do something soon, younger people will be forced to leave, in order to find work.A Central Meeting Place:At the heart of the story is the library. As an avid reader, I loved how the library went from a rigid, sterile place to an active community center. It really became the heart of the town.And in the library, there were wonderful secondary characters that enriched the novel. From the chatty moms with strollers, to the man who comes to the library, systematically looking at each book, this feels like a real place.An Underdog:The whole town is the underdog as they fight to keep the county from consolidating vital services. The county's plan may seem like a smart way to save money, but it doesn't take into account the impact it will have on the smaller communities.As the town bands together to develop an alternate plan, they all realize how much they have to gain by helping and supporting each other. They know that if their plan succeeds, younger people will have a chance to stay in the community. But if they fail, it will mean the slow death of the village.What I Didn't Like:While I enjoyed the ending, there was a plot device that was used to move certain characters into place which I thought was unnecessary. I don't like to include spoilers, but this small event felt totally thrown in and artificial. I wished that the author could have made a different choice."}, {"userName": "Deyanne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4274599-deyanne", "userReview": "This is a strong testimonial to the importance of place and especially home.

It was nice to be transported away to a rugged rural setting where a community pulls together for the \"greater good\" and the preservation of the culture that they hold dear.

But, a whirlwind romance and subsequent pregnancy led to a marriage. With the loss of that pregnancy and a decade-later birth of her daughter, she thought her life complete. But, when the realization came that her now ex-husband had a long-standing affair with a family friend, she packed up herself and her daughter and ran home. Refusing even a penny from her ex, she\u2019s reinvented herself as a prim, proper and perhaps even coldly efficient librarian in the little town of Lissbeg, rebuffing opportunities for friendship and closeness with everyone. What emerges here is the slow unraveling and unburdening of Hanna\u2019s grief, as she learns to see just who her ex-husband is, her own vulnerability and willingness to take a backseat to everyone else\u2019s ideas, her own discontent with her mother and the gradual definition of her own life, made in her own making. Sure there are huge and small missteps, some impulsive decisions and outbursts on her part and a little piece of land with an overgrown garden, leaky roof and field full of abandoned appliances, she starts to find a path. Never easy or solely gentle, the self-interest that spurred Hanna\u2019s growth was gradual, she often could be found kicking and screaming (metaphorically) with her \u2018face like the backside of a chicken\u2019 being her go-to expression through much of the story. But, what is most striking is the changes in Hanna \u2013 it isn\u2019t that we get to know her better, for she is almost wholly unlikable in her pity-party prickles out persona early on, but the changes, the flashes of optimism and determination that arise through each moment she sees something new, or takes a moment to really listen. The strength from the elderly nun, the desperation of her assistant Conor, the brightness and optimism of the girls at HaberDashery, her mum, her daughter and so many others, the story reads simply with plenty of moments, characters and conflicts that brighten and enliven the read. The growth and changes in Hanna were contrasted with the rehab of her little cottage and the stalwart, strange and always bartering Fury and the Divil, you\u2019ll want to head to this little peninsula, see the gardens and seal-cove and visit the new illuminated text in the Lissbeg Library.

And I'm glad I didn't.Hanna is the head librarian living in a little village on the West Coast of Ireland. She's divorced from a slime who made her feel like she didn't deserve a divorce settlement so she's living with her mother, her very negative, opinionated mother. Her daughter blames her for the divorce and taking away everything good in her life - and actually she probably should since Hanna never says anything about the fact that her husband never gave her anything. Hanna is tired of living with her mother and feeling like she's at the mercy of others so she decides to renovate the old cottage, shed that her aunt left her. And that leads to a whole mess of craziness because her contractor has never head of a schedule or in taking orders from the homeowner.I enjoyed this book very much, Hanna and I are of a similar age and I could relate to her situation. I did feel this book left some things unfinished so I do hope there is a sequel."}, {"userName": "Carol (Reading Ladies)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16412589-carol-reading-ladies", "userReview": "Character driven with a lovely sense of place, Library at the Edge of the World is a well written yet slow paced read. By the time a reader sees any engaging plot development one is 60% into the book. This was more time than I usually give a story and I was experiencing impatience and boredom......thus 3 stars. The last couple of chapters has some engaging action and I would rate the last part of the book 3.5 stars. Although I appreciate well developed and interesting characters and enjoyed the rural Irish country setting, I need a bit more plot in a story to be fully engaged. The author is a talented writer and I hope others will enjoy her story. It might be a good read if you\u2019re looking for a gentle read for a time when you want minimum stress in your reading material....and I think readers from Ireland or those who have spent time in Ireland might enjoy this read. I appreciate the strong theme of a woman and a community finding their voices. If you read and enjoy this story, there are 2 more books in the series. I will not be continuing with them.

It was a joy to immerse myself in Hanna's world as she navigated what, to her, felt like a return home with her tail between her legs. Hanna watched all her dreams dissolve along with her marriage, and even several years after returning home, she was still uncomfortable and unhappy.It is only when there is a threat to close her library that Hanna begins to become a real part of the community again. This book is set in a fictional peninsula on Ireland's west coast. Felicity Hayes-McCoy has created a far flung community of small rural villages that feels tremendously real. After finishing the book, I want nothing more than to visit Finfarran, especially the Lissbeg library!The characters are wonderful! Even the most minor characters are given enough detail to feel like someone who exists. Hanna and her family, Conor and all of his friends, Fury, and the community of seniors made The Library at the Edge of the World a book I will want to visit again and again."}], "description": "A warm, feel-good novel about the importance of finding a place where you belong - perfect for fans of Maeve Binchy.Local librarian Hanna Casey is wondering where it all went wrong ...
