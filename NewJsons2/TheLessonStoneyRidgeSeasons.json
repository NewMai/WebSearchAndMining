I'm pretty sure this is the third book I've read by Suzanne Woods Fisher and it may be my favorite! I absolutely loved M.K.'s character - she had me laughing a lot! I also really liked Chris's character.There were some surprises in The Lesson that made my enjoyment of the book go even higher. I also loved the mystery surrounding the unexplained death that had happened in Stoney Ridge.Even though I don't read that many Amish novels, I do enjoy a few every once in a while, and The Lesson was a great one.

I'm going to be honest and say this was not my favorite story. I liked the books about M.K.'s older sisters.But like a pesky younger sibling, M.K's tale kind of grows on you - in a good way. No only does M.K. learn a lesson, or two, about love and life expectations - especially when she's pulled into substitute teaching at the one room school; but she helps teach her father and Chris lessons that ultimately help soothe their hearts and souls.On the scale of one to five, this is a solid three. But I give the series at least a four. Once again, Suzanne Woods Fisher has created a series of \"bonnet\" books (the nickname for Amish fiction) that resonate with the truth.

Her dreams of travel have taken a backseat to her assignment to teach school this year. Nothing exciting ever seems to happen in her sleepy Amish community.But when a sudden and unexplained death conveniently coincides with the arrival of a mysterious young man, M.K. is frustrated that no one takes it seriously. She's determined to take matters into her own hands and get to the bottom of it. Will she find more than she bargained for?Centered on one of bestselling author Suzanne Woods Fisher's most loved characters, THE LESSON is the Stoney Ridge Seaons story fans have been waiting for. With a surprise at every turn, a gentle romance, and a shocking answer to an old family mystery, THE LESSON is the dramatic conclusion to the Stoney Ridge Seasons series. Readers will want to read the first two books The Keeper and The Haven as these books really are not *completely* stand-alone. They are a continuous story. You can read them out of order and not get lost, but it will lose some in the telling.I loved getting to know Mary Kate from the previous books. She is a very precocious child\u2014and young adult\u2014and oh, so dramatic! She needs to be kept busy to be kept out of trouble, but even then, trouble seems to find her. Right after the death of the sheep farmer, Mary Kate accidentally bumps into the current schoolteacher. The teacher insists on an ambulance and going to the hospital, then swears she has a concussion and can\u2019t teach (from being bumped by a scooter\u2026?) and things go from bad to worse when the school boards insists that since its M.K.\u2019s fault, she needs to teach. There are lessons to be learned, but for M.K. and others and this is a sweet Amish story with a light romance.

And this book is by far my favorite. It has everything--romance, mystery, heartache, and the undying spirit of the Amish people. If I didn't love my modern conveniences so much, I could easily turn Amish myself!!I connected with M.K. so well because I am a teacher. She was an unwlling teacher, but she discovered, as I did, how much she loved it. I love the way she worked to discover how to teach every child to meet their individual needs. It was also good to see that Amish children are just like children elswhere!I was mesmerized by the trail of mysteries running through the book. This is so much more than a coming-of-age story or even a romance. Yes, you will be certain to get your fill of genuine romance. But through it all, the hand of God guided each character that allowed Him to. Notwithstanding, even the Amish are not protected from the evil and harships of this world. I loved Chris, and I never liked Jimmy. You'll see that for herself.If you are new to Amish fiction or an absolute Amish-fiction freak, this book will not disappoint you.

I\u2019m trying really hard to reflect on this book without taking book two into account as well but it is really hard as it is a three part series. I am so discontented with the cliffhanger in The Haven and the fact that we skip years ahead in The Lesson and see an outcome (in passing really) but no hints to how things came to be. As a matter of fact\u2014this book is about an entirely different sister so of course everything truly is in passing. I have so many unanswered questions about Sadie and Will. Joe-Joe is mentioned in passing but it feels as if he is a disconnected part of the family which was very disappointing to me as well. I don\u2019t know\u2014I just feel cheated I guess. I wanted to know how everything happened and I don\u2019t feel like that happened. It feels disjointed and I hate even admitting it because I really adore this author. I just\u2014I\u2019m having a hard time figuring out what to say. If I could read The Keeper and The Lesson and forget that I really got pulled into the story of The Haven\u2014I wouldn\u2019t feel this way I think. It is definitely a very good book but I would have enjoyed it better if the book leading up to it had been concluded.View all my reviews \n  \nM.K. has grown up but in many ways she\u2019s still an unsettled little girl. At nineteen she has yet to commit to baptism into the church and her family is worried that she may leave the faith. When M.K. bumps into the hypochondriac school teacher with her scooter\u2014Alice is convinced that she is injured and needs time away. The Bishops decide that M.K. is the only one for the job\u2014much to her disdain. M.K. would much rather spend her time figuring out the mysteries of life and newcomer to the community, Chris Yoder is a mystery that M.K. is determined to crack! I really did enjoy M.K.\u2019s story but for the reasons outlined above I simply cannot give a five-star rating. Rather, I have chosen four stars. The last part of the book was the redemption of this story as I was almost certain that I was going to give this book a three-star rating. So, my suggestion is\u2014if you pick up this series, either skip the second book or be prepared to put aside your feelings and enjoy the third book for the story in which it is meant to be enjoyed for rather than carrying emotional baggage from the second book over into this one. \n  \nAmazon|CBD|Barnes&NobleI received this book free from the publisher through a fantastic program called Litfuse Publicity.

In the first two books, The Keeper and The Haven, Mary Kaye (MK) is the trouble prone little sister. At the beginning of this book, she is now nineteen, but doesn't appear to have changed much. She is nearby when an apparent murder takes place, and believing herself to be something of a detective she wants to figure out who did it. She gets into trouble with the police one too many times, until it is made clear that she is to stay away. Taking her frustrations out in physical activity, she collides with the schoolteacher, causing some injury that keeps the teacher out of the classroom. MK is made the substitute teacher as a result. MK is not at all happy about it, as being cooped up in a classroom full of kids cramps her style. Chris Yoder and his sister Jenny have moved to Stoney Ridge, where Chris is renovating property he is due to inherit in a few months. The life they left behind in Ohio had been one that Chris is anxious to put behind him. He doesn't talk to anyone about his past as he tries to make a place for himself in the new community. He is determined to give his little sister a good life, and works hard at any job he can get. He works mostly for MK's father Amos, doing whatever is needed around the farm. His dream is to renovate the property and start a horse breeding business. Chris is very wary around others, but as time goes on he begins to relax his guard around the Lapp family.Chris's thirteen year old sister Jenny isn't at all happy about the move. Leaving Ohio means she doesn't get to see her mother at all. Their mother is an addict who has also been in trouble for most of Jenny's life, and is currently serving time in a rehab facility. Jenny doesn't agree with Chris's demand that there be no contact with her, and so she writes to her mother in secret. This will cause some problems down the road when Jenny is torn between her mother and her brother.There is also MK's friend Jimmy, who has been right beside MK on many of her adventures. He continues to be rather wild and irresponsible. He makes several bad decisions through the book, one of which has repercussions on more than just him.Throughout the book, Amos's wife and former housekeeper Fern, is a stable and guiding hand to many of the characters. Her actions are not always appreciated at the time, but she has a talent for knowing just what people need.MK irritated me through the first part of the book. I thought she was immature and thoughtless for her age. It was interesting to see her reaction to having to take over as schoolteacher. She was definitely out of her comfort zone and I felt a little bit sorry for her as she struggled. Of course, it was also a bit fun to see her on the other side of the desk and having to deal with students who had been like her. I loved seeing how Fern guided MK by introducing her to the old lady who had once been a teacher. I enjoyed seeing how her influence helped MK see her potential, and loved seeing her grow into the job. She also jumped into that murder investigation without thinking things through and seeing the consequences of her actions put her on the road to a bit more maturity.I enjoyed the relationship that built between MK and Chris. I thought that they were a nice balance for each other. MK's foibles seem to mostly amuse Chris, though there are a couple times it isn't so funny for him. Chris is cautious about opening up about his past, as he and MK get closer, but he finds himself wanting to do so. MK is drawn to Chris, but his reticence about his past concerns her. But there is also something about him that calms her restlessness. I loved the way that they came together during the crisis about Jenny, and how she stood with him later."}, {"userName": "Kathleen (Kat) Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328680-kathleen-kat-smith", "userReview": "Mary Kate Lapp is a bit like George Bailey from It's A Wonderful Life. Filled with dreams of exotic places and all she desires is the right time to set out on her journey. But at nineteen, she's still struggling to find her place in the world. She's a bit impulsive, over-active, and what some would call a bit of a busy body. Still she sees nothing wrong with her flittering in and out of people's lives around her. Until they seem to lead to trouble when she least expects it. Yet Mary Kate or M.K. as her friends and family refer to her, is more than smart. She's determined, a bit strong-willed and persistent. Since adventure has yet to find her, she's making plans for something more.As luck would have it, adventure happens when and where she least expects it. While riding in her buggy one afternoon she hears a loud boom and when she investigates, it leads her to find a sheep farmer who has been murdered. M.K. takes a personal responsibility to find out who the murderer is before they kill in her small Amish community once again. But the police are less than pleased with M.K.'s offer to help solve the crime. So she does what any determined young women with a curious mind would, she sets out to find clues on her own.While in the process she runs in to quite literally, Alice Smucker, who is the town's local drama queen. When she insists that she is going to die and requests that M.K. summons an ambulance, fate intervenes. Now that Alice is out of commission, the town needs a substitute teacher and the board has just the right person in mind. That's right, M.K. After all she spent the last eight-years under Alice's schooling and isn't the slightest bit pleased when they want her to fill in for the next three weeks. She doesn't have the slightest clue how to teach a class and her room full of students is about to unleash their worst on poor M.K. Adventure has indeed come to town.In the novel, The Lesson by Suzanne Woods Fisher, we find ourselves at the concluding book in the Stoney Ridge Seasons series. In this one, the story revolves around M. K. or Mary Kate Lapp who seems to always be right in the middle of everything when she least expects it or when people would rather have her any place else. But besides adventure has she grown up enough to perhaps find someone to share in her spirited adventures or will she simply be too busy to notice what is right in front of her eyes. Just who is the new stranger that has moved into town and just why does he seem to keep to himself all the time. Is he in fact hiding something? Could it be that M.K. has found the murderer after all right beneath her nose the whole time? Well, you will need to pick this one up for yourself to find out.I received The Lesson by Suzanne Woods Fisher compliments of Litfuse Publicity and Revell Publishers for my honest review. Having read the previous books in the series, The Keeper and The Haven, I was super excited to see how Suzanne would bring all this to a closure. It can be read as a stand alone but to really get to know the characters of Stoney Ridge, you will want to pick up the other two books. This is a delightful end to the most animated character in this series and one I could relate to quite a bit with my own version of M.K. in my youngest daughter. It has allowed me to see her a bit differently than I did before and like the ending of the book, it all comes full circle when you can see where it has all been going before. For fans of Christian Amish Romance with a bit of mystery attached, you will want to place this one on your must read list! I rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Laurie Carlson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4898049-laurie-carlson", "userReview": "Who doesn't love a GREAT Amish Contemporary Romance? Suzanne Woods Fisher KNOWS how to write them! This is the third and final book in the Stoney Ridge Series, but this book can also be read as a stand-alone book, too, in case you are wondering, and it is more of along the lines of a young adult book.MK is back! Aka 'Mary Kate' (Lapp)! She's all grown up now at nineteen, and living her life the way she wants to, crazy and free-spirited, and trying to figure out just what she wants to do with it and where she wants to travel to first! Yes! She gets her Passport and is beyond happy!This book starts off with a Mystery - right up MK's alley! A farmer has been shot DEAD! MK wants to get in there and solve it, but keeps getting held back. Grrrr! It's driving her crazy!One day while riding her red scooter downhill (uh-oh!) she literally runs into her old schoolteacher WITH the scooter, who now she claims MK hurt her! The Bishop decides that MK will take the Schoolteacher's position for about the next 10 weeks, until the regular teacher heals and returns to teach. MK is NOT happy about teaching school, and she hates it! it sure seems to be taking longer than usual for the schoolteacher to heal, but as time goes on, we see MK actually really starting to enjoy the rewards of teaching! She also starts learning how to tailor the teaching to each student, and they are learning! She's feeling really good about this!Oh, MK still dreams of traveling, as she has gotten her passport, so . . . where will she go? She dreams of all kinds of different places.We have other characters that have been in the books, and this one gives us more information into their lives, and brings some closure to them.There's a little romance in here, and Jimmy Fisher is back in this book, too, along with Chris Yoder and his sister and father, while their mother is still in rehabilitation.The title of this book, The Lesson, is titled this way on purpose. All the characters in this book all 'learn lessons'. Some may be good, others not so good, but they ALL learn very worthwhile lessons about themselves and others. It was enjoyable.I did not put this in my review on my blog because this was part of a Blog Tour, but I felt MK did not grow as much as a character as she should have between books. I felt she was still a little immature, but grew a little in this book, and the romance lacked for sure. It was not what I expected. I thought by now, especially since it was the last series in the book, that she would have her suitor by now, or at least be dating in this book, which did not happen until the very end. In that sense I was a little disappointed. The book felt a little young. I was expecting a more maturely written MK.

M.K. Lapp has been my favorite character since the beginning of the series and whose story I was most interested in reading. Suzanne Woods Fisher did an amazing job developing the character of Mary Kate Lapp. M.K. is a spunky, restless soul who longs to travel and loves to use big words. The reader is immediately drawn in by M.K.'s written thoughts and her comical persona. I loved M.K.'s detective intuition. It made her stand out as a character. All of her positive, negative, and some-where-in-between attributes make M.K. a very relatable, likable and amusing character that I came to love from the first book in the series to the last page of this book. I also admired M.K.'s journey toward maturity, making decisions and paving her own way. Deep down, I can tell that M.K has a good heart and wants to help in anyway she can, despite her tendency to jump to conclusions. I think that the plot of The Lesson was the best by far. The first page immediately draws the reader into a murder scene that M.K is trying to solve. The addition of a secretive young man who, of course, is probed into answering questions, adds another layer of interest. Jimmy Fisher, witty, humorous and too handsome for his own good, keeps things interesting the whole way through. And lastly, the secret pasts of certain characters and the problems they are trying to hide add a mysterious element. All of the characters were well-developed and grew to be ones that the reader can relate to and love.Suzanne ended the book appropriately and in a satisfying manner but I secretly hoped that M.K. would end up marrying a new and improved Jimmy Fisher. Chris Yoder was a more suitable spouse for M.K. He was loving, compassionate and extremely protective of those he loved. He was careful and always a step ahead, trying to fix the problems of his past and protect his sister. Aside from being thoroughly entertained by this story, I also found inspiration, especially on page 6 with the quote, \"Every now and then, life throws you something you'd never have chosen in a million years.\"If you're looking for an amazing read, don't hesitate to pick up The Lesson. You'll laugh, cry and become emotionally attached to every character, even Fern. I rate this book 5 out of 5 stars for overall experience, plot, characters and lessons learned.

It\u2019s an interesting genre, though probably not my absolute favorite. But that aside, this series consists of three very well-written and well-put-together books. I probably won\u2019t read any other Amish books excepting ones by Leslie Gould (that is, if she continues to write them in first person) and Suzanne Woods Fisher since we are literary agency-mates, and I like to be a supporter of my fellow Hartliners.The story unfolding in this third book of the Stoney Ridge Seasons Series actually takes place quite a few years after the second book ends. The last we\u2019d seen of Mary Kate (M.K.) Lapp, she was around nine or ten years old. Now she\u2019s a nineteen year old, though at the beginning of the book, she still has some growing up to do. From M.K.\u2019s spirited interactions with Jimmy Fisher in the first two books, I really thought that he would be who she might end up with. But then Chris Yoder turned up on the scene and I wasn\u2019t so sure. I really enjoyed this book once the \u201cset up\u201d was established. I loved learning more and more about Chris Yoder and his family\u2019s dysfunctional past. I also liked seeing M.K. grow up and mature into the fine young woman the hero of the book (no, I\u2019m not telling who he is) needed her to be. I also have Suzanne Woods Fishers first book, The Choice, on my book shelf\u2014and I really hope I have the chance to read it one of these days.

I'll miss the inhabitants of the little Amish community if that is the case. Admittedly Mary Kate, the subject of this novel was not my favorite by a long shot. She truly irritated me and I suppose it is good in a way when a character really gets under your skin - but sometimes I just wanted to sit this young lady down and tell her to chill. Mary Kate, always quick to jump to conclusions does so in grand style in this tale as she assumes the new visitor to town is a murderer and thief. While he does have secrets, they do not involve stealing money and killing sheep farmers. Mary Kate also spends time racing around on a scooter with her eyes closed so she often crashes into people but blames them for being where she was going. See what I mean about her being annoying? Nothing is ever her fault. She needs a huge comeuppance and fortunately she does finally get one.As always I did thoroughly enjoy Ms. Woods Fisher's way around the Amish community. I do hold a place in my heart and reading schedule for Amish fiction and the books from this author are some of my favorites. The characters (with Mary Kate's exception) are a delight and they remind me of places I visited when I was child living in Philadelphia and then New Jersey. The stories are wholesome and the romances sweet. A nice break from some of the darker, heavier books I read.I will look forward to the next series and the next set of Amish stories from the pen of Ms. Woods Fisher."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5963420-kate", "userReview": "Sometimes loves answer lies close to the horizon.Mary Kate Lapp is suddenly on the go in search of mysterious clues to a murder victim near her homestead. Her contributions are brushed off by local enforcement and noone seems to pay her much mind. Chris Yoder, quiet and always aware of his surroundings, takes protective care of his sister Jenny quite seriously. Jimmy Fisher does not fit into the typical Amish persona. But even the best made intentions can have very interesting elements indeed.Will the murder be solved in time for love to be found in Stoney Ridge?An extremely fun, and hard to put down read. Although I have not read the previous two novels in the series I was able to pick up on the storyline right away as this book can be read as a stand alone. Numerous twists and turns held my interest and kept me following every word. Excellent character development as the personalities themselves will seem like old friends. I do not read alot of Amish fiction but this one was highly entertaining and will go back and read the first two in the series. I throughly enjoyed this well written, witty, fulfilling and original book and will certainly recommend it to others.

She is spunky, bright and a tad impulsive. Longing to see the world, she is frustrated when the school board and her step-mother Fern push her into becoming a substitute teacher. When new student Jenny Yoder comes to class, M.K. is curious about her and her older brother Chris, new arrivals in Stoney Ridge. Chris begins working for M.K's father and she finds herself drawn to him even as she is curious about his past and life. But, as answers start to come, her father steps in before M.K. and Chris can make their own decisions.With the arrival of Chris and Jenny Yoder to Stoney Ridge, Amos Lapp has to finally come to terms with a tragic accident that happened in the past. Whether he can or not will have a drastic effect on both M.K. and Chris. Suzanne has such a way with her characters and gets right into their souls. I love the Lapp family and Chris and Jenny were terrific. They are all simply fantastic characters. You feel for them, you care about them and you really want Jimmy Fisher to have some sense knocked into him! Seriously.The story can stand alone, but you really do learn a lot about M.K. in the previous books. This was a fitting conclusion to the Stoney Ridge series, although I would have loved an epilogue.

Book 3 in the \"Stoney Ridge Seasons\",but can be read as a stand alone with some re-appearing characters. See,\" The Haven\" and \" The Keeper\" not in order.

Follow, Mary Kate Lapp (M.K.) on a journey of discovery of herself, maturity,faith,finding love in unexpected places and an old family mystery. \"The Lesson\" is truly that a lesson in growing up. What a conclusion to the \"Stoney Ridge Seasons\" trilogy. Oh,don't forget to bring the tissues. Another hit for this author. I can hardly wait for her next story.

She yearns for the exciting world outside of her little town when she discovers a man who's possibly been murdered. Then she accidentally hits the schoolteacher with her scooter and she's roped into taking over her classes for a few weeks. It's her worst nightmare!There's some romance as she meets a new stranger to town. Does he have anything to do with the dead man? Why is he so secretive?This is book three in the Stoney Ridge Seasons series, but it didn't feel confusing to read this on its own. I liked Mary Kate; she's a feisty character and a lot of fun. This felt like it was geared more for young adult readers, which I wasn't expecting and I wished the mystery would have lasted longer than it did. I thought the back story and issues involving the stranger and his sister were interesting and gave the story a unique twist. Overall, I enjoyed this story and plan to read the first two.

And since I felt the previous book, The Haven, had a cliff-hanger ending, I was looking forward to seeing how Sadie's story would be resolved. But when we jump into this novel, everything with Sadie has been resolved without finding out how any of it happened!So, that was a bit frustrating, but I really like it when each book in a series tells a different person's story, and I was looking forward to see what Mary Kate would be up to in this one.From the beginning, the storylines were interesting, and Mary Kate was a fun character to read about, but I could not relate to her at all. That is fine, since I\u2019m sure that other readers will be able to connect with her, but my personality is just so completely opposite from hers that she sometimes just got on my nerves. This annoying aspect was more towards the beginning of the book, though, since M.K. grew a lot throughout this novel, which is something that I really like.Read my complete review here: http://shoopettesbookreviews.blogspot..."}, {"userName": "Amy Bradsher", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8690471-amy-bradsher", "userReview": "The Lesson has more twists and turns than a rabbit hole, keeping readers turning pages in total suspense. I loved it! With a wide cast of familiar characters who become totally intertwined in some really creative and zany ways, this book is both heart-wrenching and fun.M.K. is almost grown up, nearing twenty years old and still feeling restless. This translates into adventures for the readers as she careens around on her scooter and takes quick action on snap decisions. Because this carelessness is balanced with true heart, M.K. makes a loveable lead character as well as a fun one. These adventures and side trails translate into what makes Fisher's books so wonderful. With each character innately involved in advancing the plot and putting their own spin on M.K.'s antics, the Stoney Ridge series is unlike any other Amish book that I've read. With meaningful spiritual lessons wrapped in a fun package, The Lesson is unique but packed with realistic action. Simply put, The Lesson is captivating.I received a free copy of The Lesson from LitFuse Publicity in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5295773-judy", "userReview": "A Great End To A Great Series!I am sorry to see this series come to an end. I fell in love with Mary Kate (M.K.) from the first book \u201cThe Keeper.\u201d Quite frankly I will miss the whole Lapp family. They weave a special place in your heart. I found myself yearning for a family just like theirs. Yes, they had their share of problems but there was never a lack of love shining through. Their faith in God is such a strong faith and is shared freely with those they come in touch with.Mary Kate, what can I say? In this book we find that she has matured and grown up. I hope down the road the author will write another book updating us on the Lapp family. I\u2019d love to read what happens to Mary Kate. Does she finally learn true contentment?My heart went out to Chris and Jenny (Mitchell) Yoder. What their mother did to them broke my heart. I felt their pain. I cried for them. I also cheered for them as the Lapp family surrounded them with their love.I can\u2019t say enough about how much I enjoyed this book.

Now the youngest daughter, Mary Kate, is growing up and facing adulthood. Unlike her stable sisters, M.K. is a flighty, mischievous girl struggling to find her own way in such a structured society.If you've never read a book by Suzanne Woods Fisher before, I know you'll be pleasantly surprised. Her personal, in-depth knowledge of the Amish community and its people shines through each and every character. Her cast is rich and full of details. I enjoyed the quirkiness of Mary Kate and her persistent efforts to solve the mystery of the sheep farmer.

We are introduced to Chris \"Yoder\" in this story and my heart really aches for him and his sister's circumstances. There are some mysteries that are brought to light in this book that were never brought up in the first two books, and Amos, M.K.'s father, has to work through these issues.

I was pulled in at the first paragraph and I kept reading until I was done.Chris and Jenny's story was heartbreaking and the way that it tied into the Lapp family was even more painful.There were many Lessons in this book. M.K. doesn't want to be the teacher at the school, yet with determination, and creativity she learns how to teach, and finds that she loves it.The main lesson, was forgiveness and grace. We can't give forgiveness and grace without our Heavenly Father and the characters in this book learn that.I highly recommend this one!

A run-in (literally) with the schoolteacher compels her to act as a substitute teacher, just as her restless desire to see the world compels her to apply for a passport . . . just in case. The only thing of interest to M.K. in the sleepy Amish community of Stoney Ridge is the unexplained death of a sheep farmer that coincided with the arrival of a mysterious young man into the community. Frustrated that no one takes the crime seriously, she takes matters into her own hands. Unfortunately, as tends to be the case for M.K., she jumps headlong into trouble.Centered on one of Suzanne Woods Fisher's most loved characters, this is the story fans have eagerly anticipated. The precocious M.K. is all grown up (well, almost) and ready to take on the world--with surprising results. Fisher's trademark plot twists and turns are as unexpected and satisfying as ever in this third book in the Stoney Ridge Seasons series.", "title": "The Lesson\n      \n          (Stoney Ridge Seasons #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15863518-the-lesson", "average": 4.44, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355943883l/15863518.jpg", "reviews": 108, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1922565.Suzanne_Woods_Fisher", "name": "Suzanne Woods Fisher"}], "type": ["Amish", "Christian Fiction", "Christian Fiction", "Christian", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15863518-the-lesson", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7000455-the-choice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11547875-the-keeper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7993902-the-waiting", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10426868-a-lancaster-county-christmas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8125733-the-search"]}
