Of all kinds. Of all genres. I would seek them out, one way or another; they couldn't hide from me. From the Goosebumps books I found lying around on the shared shelves in the classrooms of my first school, to my pretentious swanning around my local library in search of those books called \"classics\" which meant you were totally smart if you read them (oh yes, I was a real delight as a child). I remember being about seven years old and asking my mum to get me a library card - I checked out the maximum of twelve each time, even though I could only read about one and a half back then before it was time to return them. Once, I even came to my mum in floods of tears because I'd let my books become overdue and thought I was going to prison.I would even find the books which people had gone to great lengths to hide from me. It's an odd memory that I doubt I'll ever forget. I must have been about eight or nine years old and my family were staying with friends in Holland. The house was beautiful. Huge. And most likely hiding a door that would lead me straight into another world if only I could find it. I stumbled through unused rooms on the third floor like a kid discovering Narnia until I found a box of books. I gravitated towards them. I can't quite tell you why, but goodreads is the sort of place where I might have a chance of finding someone who understands. I've just always read. I honestly can't remember a time before reading, when books weren't in my life. I don't know if I read as an escape or because of an interest in learning about other people or just to say I could and did. I read everything I could get my hands on. Including the books in this box, which were, shall we say, enlightening. I was appalled - appalled, I tell you! - at the things people are willing to put in their mouths. Needless to say, I read all of the book in question and instinctively never mentioned it to my parents. I'm sure some would like to think of me as a poor wee cherub whose innocence was stolen by evil books - maybe so, but I would put my money on Stine's chicken people being the real culprit rather than a bit of fellatio.No, I have never had a problem finding books to read.But I have had a problem finding people who understand what it's like to really LOVE reading. Maybe even need it. People who associate periods of their life with the kinds of things they were reading then, whether in school or in dusty old rooms of a house in Holland. The kind of people who take personal journeys into books and write responses that are part review, part stories in themselves. This is what goodreads has always given me. It's given me people who've loved a book so much that they've had to tell a story about a specific part of their life - that was the only way they could express the strength of their feeling. It's given me people who write poems for reviews or just post pictures because words aren't enough for what they want to say. A lot of these \"reviews\" don't help me decide whether I'll like a book or not. Many could be considered off-topic, not really about the book in question. And it amuses me how little the Goodreads moderators/managers/whoever actually understand: the books don't really matter.What Goodreads doesn't seem to understand is that the vast majority of their inactive members who created accounts, rated Lord of the Flies, and then quickly left - they came here because they like books. The others, the minority, who provide thousands of reviews, check the site religiously for friend updates, and are under direct attack by the new policies - they came here for the community. For the friends. For the memes. For the poems. For the rants. For the pointlessness. For the off-topic stories. For the ability to express themselves freely.Goodreads has done a truly fantastic job of not getting it. Of not getting why this site is successful. Goodreads thinks people come to this site for the books; they think they've reinvented the art of finding your next read. Oh, who are they kidding? There are a thousand other books like this and services and unused rooms in Holland that have been helping people find something to read for years. Most of them are quicker and more reliable, and all of them have fewer trolls. No. Goodreads is a long-forgotten URL in the internet history of millions of people but it means something important to only a few. I came to a site called \"Goodreads\" because I like books, but it was the people, the wonderful, off-topic people that gave me a reason to stay. You know why I'm still here after all this time? It's not the fucking books. It's the heartfelt expressions of utter delight and rage in the \"reviews\" of the friends I've made. Or it's the funny memes they post and the pictures of their cats. Or it's that teenage girl who emailed me after reading my pretty damn off-topic review of This Song Will Save Your Life and said she was going through the same thing but my review gave her encouragement to make it through each day. Goodreads, I don't need your help finding books to read.I can feel this site losing its value bit by bit. With every creative, talented and interesting person that leaves, goodreads loses more of my interest. I can honestly feel my interest waning each day. I used to keep goodreads open in a permanent tab that I would refresh a ridiculous number of times so I didn't miss anything. Now? I'm bored. This site now has more books than ever before and I'm bored. Because it was everything off-topic about Goodreads that gave the site its worth. I can find books elsewhere. Easily. Without issue. I've been doing it my whole life.This is not a protest review. For one thing, that would imply that I expect or hope it to have some kind of effect - I don't. This is not a review at all, actually. This is just a post of my thoughts for people to take as they wish. As I've always done on Goodreads and as I will continue to do. I'd say I don't care if someone deletes this, but that would be a lie. Because every deleted \"review\" is another piece of something I love being chipped away.\n  This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2927182-ellen", "userReview": "Edited 8-11-2010 to add Comment no. 4 (below) in response to Paul's follow-up question.First of all, don't tell me what I \"must\" do before I die.Just fuck off. At Paul's behest, I'm writing my reactions to this list (not really the book, but give me a break - the book is just a bunch of pretty pictures and blurbs defending their idiotic choices). What's important is this shit-for-brains list.Comment no. 1: First, they need a subtitle for \u201c1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die.\u201d I\u2019m thinking \u201cIncluding Books That Will Make You Want to Die, Peel Your Skin Off, or Shoot Yourself in the Face\u201d might do the trick. And who the hell just is this Dr. Peter Boxall? Does he know the definition of words like quiddity, esoteric, psychotic, random, fucking insane, etc.? I\u2019m hoping he does because all would apply to this half-assed, biased list.Comment no. 2: I take immediate issue (no pun intended) to the word seminal, deriving from \"semen,\" and the whole stodgy, turgid prose describing the holiness of this craptastic list: \"Each work of literature listed here is a seminal work key to understanding and appreciating the written word. These works have been handpicked by a team of international critics and literary luminaries...\" \"a seminal work key to understanding the written word\" [like books?:] !! \"literary luminaries\" !? And I can just guess which ones they are given the disproportionate number of works by minor major authors. Hey, if someone is about to die, don't make them read every shithead book Ian McEwan or John Barth ever wrote. Do you really think Roth's very minor and miss-able The Breast is going to put someone in an orgasm over the \"written word\"?Comment no. 3: I sure hope this list isn\u2019t in any particular order. I\u2019d hate to think Franzen\u2019s metaphorically and literally shit-impacted book, The Corrections is among the top 100. Oh, and nice coverage of lit before 19th century. There are a few stabs at SEVERAL CENTURIES at about book number 950 or so, but apparently we can just remain illiterate about Chaucer, Shakespeare, the Bible, Spenser, Donne, and the endless number of \u201cSEMINAL\u201d authors/books that are ignored completely. A medley of the books that are pleasant reads but hardly life changing: \u2022 The Life of Pi \u2022 Curious Incident of the Dog in Night \u2022 The Hours \u2013 how could Cunningham take such a good idea for a plot and screw it up so royally? \u2022 Surfacing \u2013 nearly anything by Margaret Atwood is worthy, but why pick one of her earliest novels, where her potential has not yet been realized? \u2022 One of Miller\u2019s Tropic books would have been more than enough thank you. \u2022 Who the hell ever heard of Wharton\u2019s Bunner Sisters? I need to read that before I die? Maybe I should read Ethan \u2013 this book sucks \u2013 Frome again too. No. For Wharton it is House of Mirth and The Age of Innocence. Colossally stupid list made into a giant and equally stupid book.AddendumComment no. 4:So Dr. Boxall/Boxass, to snatch a line from The Rainmaker, \u201cyou must be stupid, stupid, stupid.\u201d You\u2019ve now had three tries (2006, 2008, and 2010) to get this sorry ass list in shape, but you\u2019ve fucked it up every time. In response to your smarmy introduction, which Paul describes: \u201c\u2026this is supposed to be a loose and baggy overview of The Novel, as opposed to drama or biography or history or biography,\u201d I shout BULLSHIT! I\u2019ll agree with the loose and baggy adjectives, but in no way is this list a representative listing of The Novel (and what\u2019s with the reverential capital letters, asswipe?).For starters, your various lists have included short story collections (not a novel), a single short story (not a novel), autobiographies (not a novel), confessional memoirs (not a novel), histories (not a novel), creative nonfiction (not a novel) and nonfiction essay collections (not a novel). Is there something mysteriously complicated about a novel\u2019s definition, basically, \u201can extended fictional narrative in prose containing a plot,\u201d that eludes you? Do you find this definition hopelessly complex? There is a cure. Stop creating these inaccurate, nonrepresentational crap-ass lists that suggest you know something about The Novel. You don\u2019t.Then, even if Boxass were able to plant the definition of a novel firmly into his not particularly fertile brain, he\u2019d want to work on creating a list that\u2019s representational. Let me explain. The good doctor has decided to use 1001 as the definitive number for our pre-death reading pleasure. Given the number of stellar novels produced, that is a tiny number. Logically, you\u2019d accord an author no more than one book, unless there was an immensely compelling reason to do otherwise. Does Boxall do this? Noooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!In the list\u2019s most recent incarnation (and this is attempt no. 3, Boxass), the good doctor still doesn\u2019t grasp the idea of representation. In a list of only 1001 novels, should any author be accorded FIVE books? Apparently so. Boxall feels it imperative that we read, not one or two, but a whopping five novels each by J.M. Coetzee, Graham Greene, and Thomas Mann. In comparison, ground-breaking novelists like Mark Twain, Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Nathaniel Hawthorne are accorded respectively 1, 1, and 2 novels apiece. But hey! We need to save space so we\u2019re able to read FOUR books by Georges Perec, two books by Dashiell Hammett, and two books by John Le Carr\u00e9. Aaaaarrgggghhhhh!!!! I\u2019m not even going to touch all the ESSENTIAL and IMPORTANT novelists you omitted altogether, dickhead, but too bad, so sad\u2026Three strikes. You\u2019re out..."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "There are so many literary awards these days but I think the following notable achievements have been TOTALLY MISSED.

Surely they have....I wonder if it would be possible here on Goodreads to have a page listing all the 1001 books and - here's the thing - links to our own reviews of them (maybe with a limit in the case of famous books with a zillion reviews). It would be an interesting resource and would encourage people to review those which haven't got any reviews at all - say, for instance, The Taebek Mountains by Jo Jung-rae or Nervous Conditions by Tsitsi Dangarembga.

And lotsa pix of authors too, although, you know, authors are usually not the most gorgeous of people, and if you think that's stereotypical this book is here to prove it. (Exception : Edna O'Brien, total babe.)Anyway, this 1001 Books tome did turn my head when it was first published. It didn't, however, make me read anything I wasn't going to, which I guess is its point. Or maybe, its point is just to lie in the corner of your room and purr. Everybody will be shouting at this book before long as they look through it along the lines of \"what's this? You've got three in here by Douglas Adams, and NONE by Roddy Doyle? you arrant dunderheads!\" I mean, Douglas Adams is good for one, but not three... And if Douglas Adams, then Garrison Keillor... Each book gets about 300 words which editor Peter Boxall describes like this : \"What each entry does is to respond, with the cramped urgency of a deathbed confession, to what makes each novel compelling, to what it is about each novel that makes one absolutely need to read it.\" But, you know, they don't actually do that. It's just another pretty lie. 1001 books - it's a lot. If you had the time and money to read every one at a rate of one per week, you'd need 19 and a quarter years, so you better get going. But unless you're in a cult, you aren't going to do that. The pre-1700 section, in particular, is strictly for students of literature - I stick my neck out and say that very few will be reading \"Euphues : The Anatomy of Wit\" by John Lyly or \"Aithiopika\" by Heliodorus for fun. And then the dogged reader will be coming up against the rarely-scaled Everests of literature such as Dorothy Richardson's \"Pilgrimage\" (13 vols, thousands of pages) or Proust (likewise) or \"Infinite Jest\" (one volume, 1100 pages). Each of which are going to take you 3-6 months solid. Rules are broken randomly - the word \"books\" certainly appears to equate to \"novels\" in here, BUT \"Like Life\" by Lorrie Moore is included - a collection of short stories, not a novel. So okay - why no Raymond Carver, America's greatest short story writer? Stupid bastards. And sometimes it's hard to see that the reviewer even likes the book in question - \"The Secret History\" is described as \"quality trash for highbrows\"! Or take this: \"As with his other writing `The Book of Laughter and Forgetting' raises questions about the representation of female characters, and invites accusations of latent misogyny. These are valid objections that may engender fruitful considerations of this novel as a historical document as much as a work of experimental fiction.\" Well, that's hardly an enthusiastic endorsement.Some authors are wildly over-represented, such as J M Coatzee, Ian McEwan and Paul Auster, all of which have more titles in here than Henry James. It's interesting to check if the Booker Prizewinners are included - 20 are out of 37 and there are some strange omissions - no room for \"Vernon God Little\" (quite right too) or \"The True History of the Kelly Gang\", \"Sacred Hunger\" (nothing at all by Barry Unsworth in fact - what's wrong with him, he's great, you dunderheads!), \"The Famished Road\" or \"Hotel du Lac\". So this is a guide with enough in it to get everyone's backs up and please hardly anyone except Coatzee and McEwan fans. Therefore I recommend it for everyone, but particularly those who have just been sentenced to a long stretch of solitary confinement. Having said that, please check out my GR friend Ellen's fantastically vitriolic review - I don't agree with her but her views are BRACING http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/..."}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": ""}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/531153-jonathan", "userReview": "As a contributor to this, and having seen a few of the reviews, I thought I could clear a few things up: 1. The title \u2013 The publisher commissioned this book as part of its larger series of \"1001\u2026before you die\". Having this \"before you die\" was a decision made in the publishing/marketing section as it was decided it would sell better/get more discussion going. It is also, obviously, a little tongue in cheek. \"books\" rather than \"novels\", as \"novels\" was seen as potentially turning people off as it sounds too \"literary\" and \"elitist\" (I know, I know\u2026don't get me started). So, the title is pure marketing, and nothing to do with either Peter Boxall or anyone involved in either the selection of books or the reviews. 2. The list itself \u2013 Firstly, of course, it is impossible to make a \"perfect\" list. Secondly, there is author inflation due to financial and temporal pressures. This was fought by some, and the situation was improved in later editions, but I agree there is, for a start, way too much Rushdie! Boxall did the first draft of the list, which was discussed and edited and added to by us. It was, as all things done by committee, flawed. You must remember that the publishing industry is in dire straights, and simply getting this book done and out was a struggle. 3. The point of the book \u2013 the point is that it is a list of suggestions, a list of jumping off points, inspiration, ideas. Something to look through when stuck for what to read. It is not intended to be CANON."}, {"userName": "Inder", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder", "userReview": "I joined the 1001 Books group here on Goodreads, thinking, \"What a great way to get exposed to a ton of books!\" so I thought I better take a look at the actual list.Pros: Little descriptions of a lot of classic books. Lots of books described here that I have never heard of, and that I might not have known about otherwise. In fact, I may discover some new favorites through this list. Also, it appeals to my 12-year-old self, who loved to write lists of books I wanted to read. Overall, inspiring, if seriously intimidating.Cons: 1001 books is actually a lot to read in a lifetime. You'd have to average about 25 books a year, if you start at my age and live according to actuarial projections, and keep in mind, there are books like Gravity's Rainbow and Ulysses lurking in there to seriously slow you down. I fancy myself quite well read (basically because I have read Middlemarch - ever since then, I've been quite full of myself), but I've read less than 5% of the books on this list - I have a ways to go. Also, since the list (naturally, because the book had to be published at some point) terminates in 2005, you'd be pretty behind the times if you decided to ONLY read books on this list, until you die. Also, many would argue with the actual list itself: Why so much contemporary (and thus, not tried and true) fiction? Why is it almost all fiction, for that matter? Shouldn't you read some nonfiction before you die? Also, three Burroughs novels? Doesn't that violate the Geneva Convention? Certainly the 8th Amendment.What I'm saying is that the premise of the book is obviously ridiculous. Plainly, this is not really a list of books you must read before you die - that was probably the publishers' catchy title, anyway. But if you don't take it too seriously, this is fun to read, fun to disagree with, and fun to ignore. I'm inspired to try to pry my psyche out of the pre-modern era, however painful, at least long enough to read one or two novels written post-1930. (I'm sure my psyche will scuttle back into its 19th century hole directly afterwards, but I really should try to participate in the 21st century at least now and then.)In short - a rolicking nerd-fest for bookish people."}, {"userName": "Lynda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13400128-lynda", "userReview": "Yeah, I know, we GR readers already have too many books on our To Reads list! :-)As I get older my literary tastes change.

As a matter of fact, the selected edition is the second of two copies in my library, my personal one, and the one I share with my dearest reading friend and partner, Lynda.Rather, this is my indispensable guide to broadening my literary horizons. The pictured edition is that published by Cassell in 2012. However, my first edition was the first published in 2006.I emphasize that this is an evolving series. As such, as successive volumes have been published, some works have been removed while others have been added. My first edition was rather a comfort to me. For it reinforced my selection of books I had read over the course of my life. Let's say the initial volume was \"Anglo-centric.\" Here were the classics of American and English Literature on which I had cut my bookish teeth. The usual suspects are here. Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, William FaulknerErnest Hemingway, and John Steinbeck.As the series has progressed, the 1001 have taken on a decidedly international flavor. That is an exceptionally good thing. For I have begun to read much further abroad than English and American Literature. These major revisions have occurred in the 2008 and 2014 editions.This series should not be dismissed as simply another \"List of Books.\" It is far more than that. This series comes with the Literary Chops of Editor Peter Boxall a professor of English in the Department of English at the University of Sussex. He works on contemporary literature, literary theory and literary modernism. The series is further advanced by the work of innumerable scholars, specializing in the works of included authors. Some readers may well be put off by a book of this scope. Many readers always take exception to works included and excluded. Yet, it must be accepted that Literature is a constantly changing way in which the world is viewed: historically, philosophically, politically, and socially. Otherwise Literature would not have the impact on us as readers it undeniably does.Those who may be dismayed by the exclusion of beloved works previously included in earlier editions should be assuaged by knowing that most works excluded in later editions are works by authors who have had multiple listings in previous editions. By example, at one time Charles Dickens and J.M. Coetzee were the writers with the most entries; ten for each. Those have been reduced to make room for authors of significant works from different cultures and eras. That suits the mission of this series.For the Bibliophile, each edition has been a treasure trove of artwork from contemporary editions of the works reviewed. The accompanying artwork for each entry makes this an entrancingly beautiful book on, well, the beauty of books and their wonderful graphic design.If one were to make a comparison of the various editions in this series, it actually lists in excess of 1300 Books You Must Read Before You Die. It is quite doubtful I will ever read each and every volume listed in this all encompassing series of books. However, it is a work I return to time and again in looking for that next book to be read. On the other hand, I have frequently said, tongue firmly planted in cheek, that the key to immortality is a stack of unread books. \"Wait, wait, Death. I'm not done here.\"Yet, this guide has led me to books I might not ever have read otherwise. This series has pushed me beyong the limits of my usual literary comfort zone. For that, I'm exceedingly grateful.Should you decide to embark on this magnificent Literary Exploration, you, too, may find this your guide for volumes to increase your library for years to come. Oh, I highly recommend delving into this series.

For one, and for me personally very much annoyingly, I actually consider the title 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die rather majorly misleading (and the dictatorial tone a trifle off-putting as well), as ALL of the literary works listed (included) are novels or novellas. Now does this mean that Peter Boxall somehow does not consider dramatic works or poetry collections legitimate, bona fide books? I mean, sorry, but Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal are if published in print format in every way as much a book as Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Theodor Fontane's Effi Briest and Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks. And thus, why this tome has NOT been titled something more akin to 1001 Works of Prose You Must Read Before You Die I really do not even remotely understand (for frankly, when I ordered my copy of the book, I originally and wrongly assumed that both poetry and dramas would also be included, the lack of which does rather majorly frustrate, as the title, as 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die in no way makes it clear that ALL of the included literature offerings would be examples of prose, would be novels and longer short stories and novellas).Furthermore, for two, while 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die claims to be international in scope, there is (at least in my opinion) most definitely a decidedly American and United Kingdom bias shown by Peter Boxall. And while with especially most of the United Kingdom, England, novel inclusions I actually and in fact heartily agree, I do think that especially earlier French and Spanish novels seem to have come a bit short (although I do have to admit that I am pleasantly surprised at how many German language novels/novellas are included, are featured, but be that as it may, I still strongly think that 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die could be and really should be considerably more universal and international, for as it stands now, it really does seem as though Peter Boxall thinks that American and United Kingdom authors are by nature, somehow superior literature and culture wise, and even if this might never have been his intention, the feeling does permeate and remain).And finally, and I guess what actually has moved 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die from a low three star to a high two star rating for me is the massively infuriating fact of the matter that aside from Margaret Atwood, Carol Shields, and Yann Martel (whose Life of Pi I personally in fact and indeed cannot stand, and I also have to wonder if Boxall even considers Martel Canadian since he was born in Spain), Canadian literature has been pretty well ignored. And honestly, why does Peter Boxall have to include SEVEN Margaret Atwood novels? Yes, she is a talented Canadian author, but there are so many other Canadian authors equally as talented. Where is Margaret Laurence? Where is Timothy Findley? Where is W.O. Mitchell? Where is Hugh McLennon? Where is Alice Munro? Where are the many excellent Quebecois Francophone authors? And I could go on, as Canada has a rich and varied literary tradition and that Peter Boxall obviously rather believes that only Margaret Atwood (and to a certain extend Carol Shields and perhaps Yann Martel) are worthy of inclusion in his 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, that they supposedly \"represent\" Canadian Literature, well, I find this both naively blinkered (rather ill read) as well as a bit insulting. And while I do in fact sometimes browse through 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, I actually and generally ONLY tend to make use of it to check information (and plot summaries) of books with which I am already familiar (that I have already read) and not so much for finding new reading material."}, {"userName": "Marius van Blerck", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/786611-marius-van-blerck", "userReview": "The secret to immortality is revealed ... read only 1000 of these.

I wonder if it guides them as they make their life-endangering trips to this library. Or if they have better things to read.Syria's secret libraryWhen a place has been besieged for years and hunger stalks the streets, you might have thought people would have little interest in books. But enthusiasts have stocked an underground library in Syria with volumes rescued from bombed buildings - and users dodge shells and bullets to reach it.Down a flight of steep steps, as far as it's possible to go from the flying shrapnel, shelling and snipers' bullets above, is a large dimly lit room. Buried beneath a bomb-damaged building, it's home to a secret library that provides learning, hope and inspiration to many in the besieged Damascus suburb of Darayya.\"We saw that it was vital to create a new library so that we could continue our education. We put it in the basement to help stop it being destroyed by shells and bombs like so many other buildings here,\" says Anas Ahmad, a former civil engineering student who was one of the founders.The siege of Darayya by government and pro-Assad forces began nearly four years ago. Since then Anas and other volunteers, many of them also former students whose studies were brought to a halt by the war, have collected more than 14,000 books on just about every subject imaginable.Over the same period more than 2,000 people - many of them civilians - have been killed. But that has not stopped Anas and his friends scouring the devastated streets for more material to fill the library's shelves.\"In many cases we get books from bomb or shell-damaged homes. The majority of these places are near the front line, so collecting them is very dangerous,\" he says.\"We have to go through bombed-out buildings to hide ourselves from snipers. We have to be extremely careful because snipers sometimes follow us in their sights, anticipating the next step we'll take.\"At first glance the idea of people risking life and limb to collect books for a library seems bizarre. But Anas says it helps the community in all sorts of ways. Volunteers working at the hospital use the library's books to advise them on how to treat patients; untrained teachers use them to help them prepare classes; and aspiring dentists raid the shelves for advice on doing fillings and extracting teeth.About 8,000 of Darayya's population of 80,000 have fled. But nobody can leave now.Since a temporary truce broke down in May, shells and barrel bombs have fallen almost every day. For the same reason, it's long been impossible for journalists to enter Darayya, so I have been conducting interviews by Skype - my conversations repeatedly interrupted by shattering explosions, so loud that they distort the studio's speakers.The location of the library is secret because Anas and other users fear it would be targeted by Darayya's attackers if they knew where it was.As it is, the library is in an area considered too dangerous for children to approach. One young girl, Islam, tells me that she spends almost all her time indoors, playing games to help her ignore the gnawing pangs of hunger in her stomach and reading library books she is given by friends.She tells me she has no idea about the cause of the bloodshed around her.\"All I know is I'm just being fired at,\" she says.\"I'll be sitting by myself, watching some place being shelled and I'm thinking, 'Why are they bombing this place?' Sometimes I hear that someone has died because of their injuries and I ask myself, 'Why did he die, what did he do?' I don't know.\"There is one child who visits the library every day, however, because he lives next door. For 14-year-old Amjad it is safer there than being above ground, and over time his enthusiasm for the place has earned him the role of \"deputy librarian\".In one of our Skype conversations, Anas tells me that as well as aspiring teachers, doctors and dentists looking for technical or academic books, many still just read for the love of it. The majority of their most popular books are by well-known Arab writers such as the poet and playwright Ahmed Shawqi, known as the Prince of Poets, or Syrian author al-Tanawi, who chronicled rebellions in the Arab world. But he says there's also much enthusiasm for names that are more familiar in the West.\"I've read some books by French writers but I like Hamlet the best,\" says Abdulbaset Alahmar, another former student in his mid-20s.\"Shakespeare's style of writing is simply beautiful. He describes every single detail so vividly that it's like I'm in a cinema watching a film in front of me. To be honest I became so obsessed with Hamlet that I began reading it at work. In the end I had to tell myself to stop!\"But, I ask him, in a besieged town that has only had access to two aid convoys in nearly four years, wouldn't it make more sense for the library enthusiasts to spend their time looking for food rather than books?\"I believe the brain is like a muscle. And reading has definitely made mine stronger. My enlightened brain has now fed my soul too,\" he replies.\"In a sense the library gave me back my life.

Now the title might rub some folks the wrong way - hey, who are you, you high-falutin' lit'ry types, up in your academic towers, telling us what we must read? Ultimately this list is probably no better or worse than any other \"best books\" list compiled by literary scholars, though it's certainly longer than most. (I'd be amazed if any of Boxall's committee really has read every single one of these books.)The merits of the books chosen are of course open to considerable debate. They range from the big classics that every single list ever includes (Madame Bovary, Crime and Punishment, Moby-Dick, etc.) to a handful of modern genre classics (Neuromancer, Interview with the Vampire, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold) to some really obscure ones I have never heard of, nor met anyone who's read them (The Clay Machine Gun? Giles Goat-Boy? Yeah, I see some of you on my friends list are making a liar out of me...)There are two main criticisms people usually make of the list: one is that it's very Western-centric, with very few non-Western novels on the list, even going back to the 17th century. No Tale of Genji, no Water Margin, to say nothing of anything more modern.The other flaw is that it's pretty obvious that some of the literary panelists just stuck as many books by their favorite author as they could on the list. I mean, I like Charles Dickens, but I don't think he needs to be on the list 10 times. He does not make up 1% of the world's most important literature all by himself! Philip Roth: 7, Virginia Woolf: 9, Jane Austen: 6, etc. I know it's probably hard to choose which of Jane Austen's six novels are the best/most important, but come on \u2014 I'd agree everyone should read at least one or two of her books, but not all of them, unless you actually like Jane Austen (which I do, incidentally).So, anyway, I understand the revised 2010 edition has addressed this a bit, with fewer Dickens and more non-Western inclusions.The summary of each book is brief and not always very illuminating. None of them really argue passionately for why this particular book (especially if it's only one of many by the same author) deserves to be on your literary life list. However, in a brief allotment of words, each book gets a page on its qualities and what it has to offer.So, this is the sort of book that's interesting to have on your shelves and to page through. And I have been semi-randomly making my way through it, sometimes choosing books I would never otherwise have read. You can see my list here. Some have been delightful surprises, some were just an opportunity to read one of those books everyone is supposed to have read in high school but I never did (hence my finally getting around to Wuthering Heights and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), and some I do not think my life would have been diminished by missing.I still haven't read Moby-Dick or The Great Gatsby yet.Personally, I found Jane Smiley's 13 Ways of Looking at the Novel a more engaging and personal read, with her list of a 100 books which she personally read (or reread) for their importance. But 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die is a hefty doorstopper worthy of any book-lover's collection, though I'd like to meet the person who's actually read all 1001.

It either bestows a sense of satisfaction in seeing one's tastes validated or inspires a pleasing self-righteous indignation at seeing certain books excluded; usually it does a little of both. \"1,000 Books You Must Read Before You Die\" includes contributions by over one hundred international critics, and, in addition to serving as an amusement, it also serves as a handy reference with summaries of 1,001 different books in 300 or words or less. I'm not quite sure what criteria was used to compile this list (here comes the pleasing indignation); it is heavily weighted toward the 1900's, giving barely a passing glance to classical world literature. In the pre-1700's section, which numbers a pathetic less-than-15 pages, there is no Iliad, no Odyssey, no Beowulf, no Canterbury Tales, no Decameron, no Inferno \u2026but there is Chariton's Chaireas and Kallirhoe? Huh? I suppose the defense given for such omissions may be that these are not \"novels,\" and this is (I guess?) supposed to be a list of \"novels,\" but that is not in fact the case: the list includes numerous essays and individual short stories as well (since when did \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" or \"A Modest Proposal\" qualify as \"novels\"?) I think they would have done better to have begun with the 1700's, simply omitted the short stories and essays, and called it \"1001 novels,\" if a novel list was truly their goal. Because if we really want to talk about *books* to read before you *DIE*, the list is badly lacking. Aside from the classic omissions previously mentioned, why no Bible, no Bahagvad Gita, no Koran, no Tao Te Ching - nothing at all in that vein? But enough of the omissions; what of the inclusions? The \"MUST read\" portion of the title seems a bit hyperbolic to me. MUST I really read a *minimum* of half a dozen books that include *multiple* scenes of female rape and/or sexual degradation before I die? Surely I could live a fulfilling and educated life having read but one or two such books? Or perhaps I could make it through life, enlightened, informed, educated, moved, even inspired\u2014without even reading one such book. Many of the descriptions seem to take relish in the anti-capitalist themes of many of the books, and I sometimes wondered if a book or two wasn't chosen precisely because of it's anti-capitalist bent. That might also help to explain that, among hundreds and hundreds of 20th century titles, not a single book by Ayn Rand was included: a rather glaring omission in 20th century literature when one considers her cultish following and impact. I'm still plodding through this, patting myself on the back at what I have read, and of the hundreds and hundreds of books I haven't read\u2014trying to decide which might be worth the time. I will have read 1,001 books before I die, most likely (God willing and the creek don't rise)\u2014but certainly not all or even most of these 1,001. I kept changing this back and forth between two and three stars, and I finally settled on three. I rate the selection poorly, but as a reference book, it's really quite good. The summaries are well written and concise and do, I think, a fairly good job of giving me a notion as to whether I would want to read the book or not. But once again I'm reverting to the lower score, because I'm sitting here thinking - come on now!

Check this book out. It gives a general synopsis of 1001 \"classic literature novels\" that \"you MUST read before you die\". For that, it is useful. But it is not even close to being complete.Surprisingly, the editor has organized the books by century, which I found encouraging, because at least I know they appreciate older literature for its value and influence over the formation of literature as we know it. I have flipped through every single one of those 1001 books (no, I did not count them, so for all I know there could be 1002 listed) and have counted 35 out of the 1001 that I have read in entirety. Add another 25 for the books I have at least attempted to read for school or the like, and that makes my total around 60. 60 out of 1001 (or about 6%). This raises the question of what constitutes a book as being worthy of being on this list? Because I have read a lot more than just 60 books in my life, so where are those? I recognize that this book was published in 2006, so any books written in the last 5 years would not be included. But there are a lot of books that are on my \"What I would recommend to anyone who reads\" list that are not included in this book. Does this make them not worthy? Now don't get me wrong, I assume that all of the books listed are worthy for one reason or another, but I wonder why you have to include all 6 novels by Jane Austen. Is it just because she is Jane Austen? Where are the books I fell in love with in high school? Where are the children's novels that introduce children to the wonderful world of the story? Why isn't children's literature worthy of being included in a list of books you MUST read before you die? Personally, I think this list is different for everyone. Yes, I believe that there are some staple novels that have been written since the beginning of the novel that I think everyone should read if they want to call themselves well-read. But to have a list of 1001 books, a list that includes all of the works by the great authors of literature rather than a collection of different types of books, by different authors, seems counter-productive. I mean, you read one Jane Austen, you read them all, right? (I deeply apologize to the Jane Austen fans out there, but you have to agree, they are very similarly structured in style, theme, and character development). So why not instead include stories like Beowulf, or Utopia by Sir Thomas More, or The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, or The Kite Runner by Khaled Houssini, or Life of Pie by Yann Martel, or Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, or Democracy by Joan Didion, or a Walker Percy novel. The list goes on and on. I am not complaining about books that make lists such as \"1001 books you must read before you die\" because I, for one, love making lists. But just be wary of the lack of complete comprehensiveness that one might expect in a huge book filled with over one thousand great books. Take it with a grain of salt, and keep reading what you love.

I particularly love book lists. For example, I've compiled in excel lists of horror, thriller, romance, and lit fit books with cross referenced awards and \"best of\" lists. I particularly like lists such as Mystery Writers of America's Top 100 mystery/thrillers of all time, or RWA's \"1001 Best Romance\" list. I also like to peruse the Goodread's Choice Awards (voted on by readers in the thousands), Amazon, Publisher's Weekly, and NPR's annual lists. It's certainly valuable to have recommendation lists from experts in their field and from readers en masse. So naturally, I was drawn to this book. I joined a challenge to read 25 titles from this list this year. Digging into it, I have to say the selection of books is very odd and disappointing. I've read the comments others have left, including one that appears to be from the publisher (aka \"a contributor\") saying the books were selected \"by committee\" and that it wasn't ever meant to be a true \"best of\" list and that yes, some books were added because \"the publishing industry is in dire straights\". (In other words, to sell copies of the books the publisher represents).Of course, anyone has a right to make a list, and the editor and publisher of this book likewise. I guess what's sad to me is that this list/book is one of the only of it's kind and very prominent, taken nearly as gospel, whereas the list itself is questionable at best. As other reviewers have pointed out, it reads like a bunch of \"literary fiction\" authors got together and nominated ALL of each other's books. There are books, year after year, by the same authors like Philip Roth and J.M. Coetzee, even though these books are clearly minor works. I tend to look at the goodreads reviews/rankings on each title to see if I really want to attempt them, and many times the blurb and reviews put me right off. Of course, there are some great books on the list like John Le Carre's \"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold\", \"The Bluest Eye\" by Toni Morrison, or Ira Levin's \"Rosemary's Baby\". And I found a few gems I never would have read like \"High Rise\" by J.G. Ballard and \"The Summer Book\" by Tove Jannson. However, there's also a lot of dross here, and it definitely skews towards supposedly high brow books that are obtuse, forgettable, and not especially readable.I would love to see a physical book like this, with the lovely pictures and write-ups, that represent that 1001 most readable and entertaining books from various genres and lit fic, as well as books that had a true impact and still have something to say like Toni Morrison's \"Beloved\" and \"To Kill a Mockingbird\".

I have to admit, I was skeptical about this book. My first thought was, roughly, \"Why should I pay for a book that's just a big list of better books?\"Well, thanks to the Orange County public library system, I don't have to pay for it. So now I have it (for three weeks, anyway), and I'm actually enjoying it a lot.It's very browsable \u2014 it's easy to flip through and skim, and somehow it doesn't feel overwhelming. Each page has entries on one or two books, with generally just the right blend of objective plot description plus editorial opinion. (Amazon calls these \"authoritative yet opinionated\" critical essays.) Sometimes I'll skim the first descriptive paragraph and feel completely unmoved (e.g. \"cultural identity...slum...Jewish boy...urban...eh, probably won't bother reading this one\"), but then the next paragraph deems the book \"one of the most authentic, moving accounts of childhood terror in literature,\" and suddenly it feels worth reading. (That one was Call it Sleep by Henry Roth.) Some of them say things like, \"This is not one of his most popular novels, but here's why you should read it anyway.\" (I'm paraphrasing.)I appreciate the honesty and the overall mission of this book. I know I wasn\u2019t directly quoting that \"here\u2019s why you should read it anyway\" sentence, but that's one of the sentiments that the 1001 Books contributors express over and over again. \"Here is a barrier to reading this book, and here is why it's important to read anyway.\" Okay, how about an actual example. Finnegans Wake: \"Joyce's last book is perhaps the most daunting work of fiction ever written. Yet it is also one of the funniest...\" Maybe I don't really want to be bothered to work through the most daunting work of fiction in the history of fiction. But how can I pass up one of the funniest?One common barrier to reading many of the books compiled here is that they are, quite simply, enormous books. The writers of 1001 Books don't dance around that fact; they want readers to know what they're getting themselves into. But they also want readers to keep reading. On Clarissa: \"The sheer scale of Clarissa means that it can seem a novel that is more talked about than read. Yet for those readers who are prepared to spend time with it, Clarissa offers a proportionate amount of satisfaction.\" Or Moby-Dick: \"A huge, monstrous, and yet exquisitely refined creation . . . Just reading the novel constitutes an experience every bit as wondrous and exhausting as the journey it recounts.\" Of course these days I can't mention huge/monstrous/exquisite novels without thinking of Infinite Jest. Sure enough, it's in here. And how does the editor sell the reader on it? \"This text is the one you would take with you to a desert island.\" See that? THE one. The editor's basically saying, \"You know that list of books you always imagine you'd like to have with you on a desert island? Burn it. Take this book and only this book.\" How can you argue with that?Many people, not surprisingly, criticize this book. In my cursory Internet search, the broadest complaint I've found is, in the words of one reviewer, \"WHY MUST I READ THESE????\"I think this complaint can be broken down into two slightly different complaints: \"WHY must I read these?\" and \"Why must I read THESE?\"For answers, the reader need only look to the book's preface and introduction. In the preface, Peter Ackroyd lays out several reasons why we should read. Some books \"stand outside the currents of ordinary change and represent something close to enduring human value\" \u2014 they are timeless. Other books \"act as the symbol of an age or a period\" \u2014 they are important for understanding a piece of history. His overarching claim is that \"all of them invite the pleasure of reading.\"But why these? All of them invite the pleasure of reading. Okay. But all books do that, or they wouldn't get published, right? Why these 1001 books and not a different 1001? Peter Boxall tries to answer this in his introduction. He's quick to point out that this is not an exhaustive list of books we must read. Such a list would be impossible to create. Note that this is a collection of 1001 books to read before you die, not the 1001 books to read before you die. I think the lack of article before \"1001\u2033 in the title means that, yes, you should read these books, but guess what? You should read other books too. You should read as many books as you can, probably. And then there will always be more books you should read. That's the main point of Boxall's introduction: there is no way on Earth to pin down a list of books that everybody should read. He even goes so far as to say that the novel (wait for it...) does not really exist. This time I am quoting, not paraphrasing: \"It might be argued that the novel, as a stable, recognizable object, does not really exist.\" The form or definition of a novel is incredibly hard to pin down \u2014 vaguer still is the delineation between good and bad, trashy and masterful.Honestly? You're not going to like every book in this book. I've done my fair share of eye-rolling at some of the choices. And I share other people's questions about some of the less obvious decisions (e.g. the fact that the second half of the selections are from the last 50 years). But I doubt you could write a list of 1001 anything that would please everybody. If I wrote a list of 1001 foods you must eat before you die, a lot of it would be pretty straightforward. And yet for every concurrence, there would undoubtedly be at least one criticism. Chocolate would rank pretty high on my list. But some people actually don't like chocolate! You wouldn't see soda anywhere on my list (not Coke or Pepsi or even Sprite), but some people can hardly envision a (Happy) meal without it.Actually, trying to think up a list of 1001 must-eat foods turns out to be very instructive. My first thought is to include things like pizza and ice cream, stuff that is totally obvious and totally delicious, and yes, almost everyone has already eaten these things, and everybody already knows they\u2019re great, but that's why they need to be on the list. Or do they? In fact that\u2019s one thing people criticized about 1001 Books \u2014 \"I don\u2019t need to be TOLD to read Virginia Woolf; everybody KNOWS you\u2019re supposed to read Virginia Woolf, and anyway I HATE Virginia Woolf and I\u2019m never ever going to read anything she ever wrote. So there.\" Oookay, so maybe The List is supposed to be made up of things the average person wouldn\u2019t necessarily know about or bother with, things like oysters or apple drinking vinegar. The problem is that if you populate the list too heavily with obscure items, you run out of room for the classics, and then you inevitably run into the opposing criticism: \"How can you write a list like this without including BACON? Or JELLO? Or BROCCOLI?!\"I guess all I'm trying to say is that you can't please everyone.One of the huffy criticisms I found went something like, \"Even if I read ONE of these books a WEEK, and NOTHING ELSE, it would take me, like, 20 YEARS to get through the list.\" Well, okay. It's called 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, not 1001 Books You Must Read Before Your 35th Birthday, or 1001 Books You Must Have Already Read or Else You're Definitely a Big Loser. The point is that these editors believe that if you were to devote a lifetime to reading fiction, you wouldn't go far wrong by sticking to this list. At least if your lifetime ended in 2005, I guess. But you get the point.I may never read all of these books. Certainly at the rate I'm going, I'd have to live for several hundred years to complete the task. But it's doable, if you set your mind to it, and even if you don't, it's an excellent resource. Every time I'm looking for something new to read, I can open 1001 Books at random and pick out something worthwhile. It might be something I've never heard of, or something I'm ashamed I've never read.I think it's cool. In fact, the next time I'm looking to spend $34.95, I just might spend it on this."}, {"userName": "E\u2113\u2113is \u2665", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46838158-e-is", "userReview": "Da consultazione."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214774-jennifer", "userReview": "Obviously this \"list\" isn't perfect.

There are many wonderful photos, drawings, book covers, etc. that enhance the text/book descriptions. I had every intention of reading this book cover to cover, and some day I might do that; I do read many so-called reference books (such as cookbooks) 100%. But, it\u2019s a 960 page book and I\u2019ve decided I\u2019d rather use this as a traditional reference book and read other books instead. If I refer to it too often I\u2019m afraid my to-read list will get more unwieldy than it is now. I was pleased to see that I\u2019ve read more of these than I would have guessed and that I already have some of them on my current to-read list. Makes me wish I wasn\u2019t already so old! ;-)The problem I have with books such as this is that I always feel that worthy books are left out and I\u2019m confused by certain ones that are included, which is true here too. Although the over one hundred international critics (that wrote this book) did do a good job here. I think I actually prefer the Book Lust books, even though they are not as comprehensive, because they\u2019re great fun; this one takes itself completely seriously."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10665178-sara", "userReview": "I just bought this book used for $2.99.

Some books are obviously on there. Other books - well? I can't give an opinion yet on some of those I've never heard of. It must all be ultimately subjective but some books have stood the test of time and some of the more recent ones - who knows?

A list of the titles is more than sufficient for me. I got the impression that the titles were selected less because the author likes them and more because they're historically significant books. Which, believe me, is not a bad thing, and good tends to go hand in hand with significant. However, they're going to be the same titles you'd see on any other Must Read list, but compiled in one expensive book. I much preferred Nancy Pearl's Book Lust titles.
