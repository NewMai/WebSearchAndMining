A good, healthy dose of often-overlooked history, this gives a decent overview of women's roles in the healing arts and sciences from ancient times through the 20th century. There's a pretty heavy feminist slant, of course, as the \"bad MEN of modern medicine\" marginalize and minimize women's knowledge and participation, pushing them into the rather questionable role of midwife/abortionist. It does get a bit old, though, to be told over and over how backward modern (male) medical treatments are compared to the oh-so-wise-and-in-touch-with-nature treatments proffered by the old wives, such as wearing red flannel around the neck to ease a sore throat. It seemed to me that neither the old wives nor the medical scientists had any kind of monopoly on sound medical advice -- or on ridiculous quack treatments. This book would have come across as far more fair and logical if it had acknowledged this point a bit more readily.One of the most fascinating parts of the book is the listing of remedies at the end. There are a few which do have actual medical efficacy, but most are silly, bizarre, or even grotesque instructions for \"curing\" everything from acne to plague. While this was amusing, it would have been far more interesting to learn a bit more about how these \"cures\" were derived."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119592-liz", "userReview": "Alright, so to preface, my great-grandmother was the type of person to be classified as a \"wise woman\" by this book's standards, hence why when I saw this at the book store, I was drawn to it. For a nonfiction book, this was somewhat... emotional. It was strange in a way, because it was presented quite objectively, even if it had an obvious slant. There is a great section of history I have glazed over, which makes me somewhat sad.This isn't a dime store Wicca book (heck, it isn't even a dime store herbalism book), it's a discussion of history of the quieter sect.There are a lot of things tied up in medicine that we don't notice, with our vaccinations and penicillin. That to some extent, the medical profession lives a little in the Dark Ages.Anyone wants to borrow it, I'd gladly lend it to them, just saying."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9581828-lauren", "userReview": "[headaches (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Icy Sedgwick", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4415716-icy-sedgwick", "userReview": "This is less a compendium of old wives' tales (as I was expecting) and more of a history of medicine with a feminist slant. Chamberlain inserts the tradition of the \"wise woman\" back into medical history, exposing the inherent gender bias that colours medical science even to this day. The book is not designed to be used as a herbal textbook, nor is it a 'Wicca-lite' spellbook - instead, it's a fascinating non-fiction history book, with the remedies and spells inserted as examples. Despite the subject, it's an easy read, and highly recommended for anyone with a historical interest in herbalism, or women's history."}, {"userName": "Tuborg Skratulja", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13191078-tuborg-skratulja", "userReview": "Interesting, informative for someone whose background is nursing, but found it, it was with feministic influences.

What are old wives\u2019 tales? Where do they come from? Do they really work? These questions, and many more, are answered in this fascinating compendium of remedies and cures handed down from mother to daughter from the beginning of time. We may all know that stewed prunes are a cure for constipation, but how many of us were aware that a poultice of chicken manure is a remedy for baldness? Or that eel liver will aid a difficult labor?", "title": "Old Wives' Tales: The History of Remedies, Charms and Spells", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9513220-old-wives-tales", "average": 3.63, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328818633l/9513220.jpg", "reviews": 5, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/258029.Mary_Chamberlain", "name": "Mary Chamberlain"}], "type": ["History", "Nonfiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9513220-old-wives-tales", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/459941.Old_Wives_Tales", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20051904-old-wives-tales", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1803592.Old_Wives_Tales", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25278972-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29938349-de-pourpre-et-de-soie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10388056-fenwomen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37908238-la-modista-de-dover-street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2702829-writing-lives"]}
