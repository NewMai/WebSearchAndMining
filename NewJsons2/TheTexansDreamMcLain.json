An Irish gal, Karina O'Reilly, shortened to Kara, kept blowing hot and cold on Jonathan Catlin, her boss. Meanwhile, he blew hot and cold right back! Several silly squabbles. In the end, I simply didn't care about their relationship.Jonathan was initially portrayed as a cold, hard, killer with no friends, no love, etc. But in reality, the author completely countered her initial portrayal. Jonathan was kind and loyal, with a loving sister and several very good friends and in-laws. Poorly written. Repetitive. Too much focus on mundane details, like the detailed shopping trip in Kansas City. The language was sometimes absurd. Kara would say \"aye\" and incorrectly use \"me\" whenever she got mad, just to sound more Irish, but the rest of her syntax was classic standard English. Her green eyes would flash every time she got mad, just to remind us she is Irish. Sigh. Her father, an Irish immigrant, puts her on a train, telling her to \"lose the accent\" (a modern expression) and to \"be careful in whom you trust.\" (\"whom\" -- I kid you not). Also, I could not like how Thomas referred to Angela as \"the old maid\" repeatedly. Especially irritating was when Thomas would use Angela's name and also refer to her as the old maid, all in the same sentence, something like this non quote: \"Angela seemed happy, but the old maid would not leave her room after sunset.\" Character development for Angela was just bizarre! Thomas initially portrayed her as shy and yet kind, tall and a bit plump. Later she called her \"a withered and misanthropic old maid.\" Sloppy work! Incomplete plot. Big unanswered question: Who was shooting the old guard? Sloppy!! Also, it seems very unlikely that some cowboys know where the red flowers grew, and picked them for the main house, but they told no one about the secret place on the ranch??Multiple courtships. Four couples get together in this story. A happy ending for all. Much too trite. Some of these stories were potentially deep, especially Quil's, but it gets an easy enough HEA.Some typos, not too bad, but each paragraph was set apart with two line spaces. This occurred in the entire book, an irritating formatting glitch."}, {"userName": "Shirlene", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5700960-shirlene", "userReview": "In Pittsburg, Pennsylvania...Charlie O'Riley told his daughter, Karina Page O'Riley, to not try to contact him for one year. He shoved her on a train and she left behind a town where at least two houses were burning. She left without talking to Devin, O'Toole, the man she was supposed to marry. Her father told Karina that Devin knew she was leaving and he would see her in a year. Charlie told Karina that she needed to leave so that maybe they both could stay alive. She needed to get off the train somewhere when no one was watching and would notice her being gone. Her father had worked his way up in the steel mills and held a lot of secret meetings. Karina knew that her father had made a lot of enemies but she didn't really know why she had been sent away. Karina had shortened her name to Kara and run out of the money her father had given her. She had spent most of her money training for a job as a bookkeeper but she didn't do very well at her studies. She was in Kansas City and applied for a position as bookkeeper for Jonathan Catlin. Jonathan had been given his grandmother's ranch in her will but he had only twelve months to make it profitable or the land would be given to the state of Texas. He needed a bookkeeper and he needed to make the ranch profitable so he could sell it and continue to travel. Jonathan overheard his lawyer interviewing Kara. He had been having trouble finding someone would take a position for a year and that would involve traveling such a distance. Clark, the lawyer, gave Kara $50 to purchase items she would need in Texas. As Kara was leaving, she met Jonathan. He told her a couple stories about life and the harsh winters she was likely to encounter in Texas and scared her. She thought about returning the money and not taking the position. She went back to quit but Clark had left for the day. She wanted to leave without running into Jonathan again and decided to leave out the upstairs window. She landed on Jonathan and her heel left a cut above his newly blackened eye. She took him to the doctor and Jonathan got her a room at his hotel and told her to meet him for dinner. Kara left to go shopping. She ended up purchasing some food for a widow at the store, the widow needed coal to cook the food and then paid her rent so that she had a place to cook the food. Kara ended up spending all her money and time getting items for the widow and had only a pair of shoes for herself. He boots were left in the store and it was closed by the time Kara had taken care of the widow's items.She returned the the hotel and didn't want Jonathan to see that she only had one new pair of shoes so she didn't meet him for dinner. He took a chance and went to her room to see if she was there. She was and Jonathan ordered a bath for her and dinner to be served in his room. He convinced her to meet him and she told him what had happened. He didn't believe her and when she fell asleep, he went out and checked out her story and was impressed to find out that she had told the truth and he found the store owner and got the supplies she had left at the store when it closed. He carried Kara to her room and woke her up in the morning when it was time to leave. She then found all the items.As they were getting in a wagon to head for the train, someone shot at them. Kara and Jonathan both thought that someone was after each of them. Wolf met them as they were getting on the train to head out. Wolf make Jonathan tell her that they were making a stop where an Indian that he knew was being held. They wanted Kara to bring his baby out to help his friend. They went to get the baby but the baby had already died and they took the body out without the Indian knowing that he had lost his child. Jonathan felt bad and went and got drunk and fought with some guys in a bar. Wolf came and pulled him out and Kara cleaned him up. She was touching him and she didn't know why. She just felt like it and thought it would be OK since he was passed out. He got up when Kara was leaving and kissed her. The continued on to the ranch and Kara took over the books. They were attracted to each other and Kara came to realize that her fiancee had never really asked her to marry him. He had just mentioned it a few times when he came to visit her father. There was no passion and she came to notice that Jonathan was attracted to her and she to him. They agreed to keep their hands off each other but that didn't seem to work. The other's at the ranch all thought they were in a relationship. Kara set out to prove them wrong and Jonathan had a couple of the Old Guards move into the house as chaperones. Nicole sent a note to Jonathan to come to Ft. Worth and they left during a storm headed to Ft. Worth. Willis and the foreman, Newton, accompanied they. Willis had a stroke and died without making it back to the ranch. The note was because the Rangers had caught a white woman who had been raised by Indians and had a baby. She couldn't remember any English. Jonathan could talk to her in Apache and they took her back to the ranch. Her name was best translated into Dawn. One night, they noticed someone moving around in the dark within the ranch walls. It turned out that it was one of the ranch hands. Cooper was going to visit the cook, Angela. Angela was the daughter of one of the ranch hands. Angela's mother had died having her and her father ended up being killed. Her father was one of the Wells's, a neighbors, son. The families didn't get along because neither family approved of the relationship. Well's had never seen his son's child, Angela. Angela was afraid to go out after dark because of the stories told to her by her grandfather. Cooper ended up getting shot at later in the story and Angela took care of him. Cooper was confronted by her grandfather and they were married.After a particularly bad snow, Jonathan took a couple of guys out looking for strays. Cooper and Snort were shot. There were quite a large number of cattle missing and the Well's were blamed. Jonathan took a trip to Kansas City to pick up supplies. He brought back Mary Ann, the widow that Kara had helped. He also brought Devin O'Toole. Jonathan noticed that he didn't seem affectionate at all towards Kara and Kara wasn't sure what she had seen in Devin. Something seemed off about him showing up and his story about her father. Jonathan told her she didn't have to go with him if she didn't want to and she told both of them she wouldn't be leaving to go back with him. Shortly before Christmas, Jonathan invited Kara to a dance. While at the barn dance, he overheard some soldiers talking about an Indian they had captured who was locked up. It was too close to Christmas for someone to come pick him up to take him for a trial. Jonathan invited the soldiers to Christmas dinner, knowing that they would bring the Indian with them. He thought it might be his Indian brother, Quil, whose baby they had buried. It was him and Dawn was the one who got him to eat and calmed him down enough for Adam to treat when he came with his family for Christmas. The McLain brothers and their families all came for Christmas along with the soldiers with Quil. Devin got Kara alone and told her that he had a part in killing her father and that he was a part of the family who was trying to kill hers. He had found out that Kara's father had purchased quite a bit of stock in the steel mill where he worked and it was in Kara's name. He had come to find Kara to get the stock certificates that she didn't know were in her luggage. He used a gun to make Kara go with him. It was his intention to marry her to get the stocks and then kill her if he needed to. He just wanted to be rich. Kara went with him but left her glasses, knowing that Jonathan would figure out that she would never go anywhere she wanted without them. Jonathan found the note and the glasses and went to find them. Kara had knocked Devin out cold, he woke up and had a gun on them both but Jonathan was also followed by one of the Old Guards, H.B. Jonathan knocked Devin out flat when he sneezed from the cold he had. H.B. told Jonathan that he had found the canyon that others had spoken of that had flowers in the winter. Jonathan went there with Kara and they made love there in the canyon for the first time. They went back and in order to free Quil, Jonathan fought Quil and beat him. They told the soldiers that he was dead but they took him, Dawn and her baby to the canyon. The stray cattle were there too. They figured out that the cattle could get into the canyon when the stream was frozen but when it thawed, the cattle had no way to get out. The cattle weren't really stolen by the Well's family as they believed. Well's came to see Jonathan at Christmas. He told Jonathan that he had caught one of the cattle rustlers. He figured that if the rustler's were stealing cattle from both ranches and he wanted to work with Jonathan to catch them all. He also asked to see his son's daughter. Jonathan agreed to let him come have Christmas dinner with all of them. Jonathan and Kara were married in the small chapel on the ranch property. The soldier's prepared to leave and thanked one of the Old Guards, Snort, for wrapping up the (dead?) Indian in a rug for them. It was actually Devin who had been given medicine to knock him out..."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7958059-amy", "userReview": "I haven't been reading the series an order but it doesn't really seem to matter. I have to say that so far I've enjoyed all of the books I have read. And this installment, we meet Kara and Jonathan. I really like Cara a lot although I have to admit that some of her actions the beginning of the book made me seriously question her sanity. However when Jonathan made good on what she had done, it all came together. I liked meeting Marianne is well and was pleased to see she was taken care of. I don't completely understand exactly what role Kara's father played in Pittsburgh but the way it wound up made a lot of sense. Everything came together. It was also great to see Jonathan's Apache brother and his story come to a good resolution. I really like the writing style of the author and the plot development was very well done. I look forward to the rest of the series. On a sidenote, I am also grateful for services that help keep track of the books that I have read because without such A service I would have lost track of which books in the series I read! But they are all good and I guess that is the important thing!"}, {"userName": "Diah Didi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/370306-diah-didi", "userReview": "Since I loved Wife Lottery series, I kinda had a big expectations reading this. I bought this used book without knowing it's the last series. But somehow it's not that great. I did love the story, the relationship between Kara and Jonathan, along with his people in Caitlin's Ranch. Especially how Jonathan's guards acted around and toward Kara. But I was hoping there would be conflict involving Kara and Quil, Jonathan's Indian used-to-be best friend since Kara once acted she's saving his son when the baby's already dead.My favorite part: When Kara throws those food to Jonathan when he offered her an arrangement without him realizing he's making a huge mistake. No wonder Newton fell on his knees laughing, hard. :)"}, {"userName": "Jacqueline Sinard", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7513358-jacqueline-sinard", "userReview": "Loved this book. The characters were well thought out and several times I found myself chuckling quitely as I read it. I mean who wouldn't laugh at an anrgy irish woman throwing food at the man who just unknowingly insulted her. Jonathon had it coming he just didn't know it. But as much as the book is funny, it is also sweet. After he realized that he had hurt her feelings, he apologized and used the sweetest words.Would definitely recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6905493-linda", "userReview": "I have read quite a few of Jodi Thomas' books and have loved every one of them.
