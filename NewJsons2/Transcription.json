But for me this wasn't as epic as A God in Ruins, and by the end the plotting was too clever for its own good, even to the point where I felt a little cheated by what had come before. But still, I'll read anything this woman writes."}, {"userName": "Latkins", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27603384-latkins", "userReview": "Another great novel from Kate Atkinson, this is also the second novel I've read this year which is about spies in London, dealing with fifth columnists and Nazi sympathisers during the Second World War - the other being the equally excellent Our Friends in Berlin by Anthony Quinn. Both were inspired by newly declassified documents, I believe. Anyway, this novel follows Juliet Armstrong, an orphan who's recruited into MI5 in 1940 and who finds herself transcribing covertly recorded conversations between spy Godfrey Toby and a range of Nazi sympathisers who believe that he is working for Germany. As well as this, she's asked to sound out another fifth columnist by posing as a different young woman, a mission which goes terribly wrong. It also describes her life in the 1950s, when she works for the BBC, and finds that her past has come back to haunt her. As usual with Atkinson, there is a seam of dark humour which runs through this novel, as Juliet seems to be at mercy of the whims of various MI5 agents. It's thoroughly enjoyable, and will delight both fans of Atkinson and fans of spy thrillers, as there is a central mystery which will keep you guessing until the end."}, {"userName": "Billie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3915342-billie", "userReview": "It was fine, but I never really connected with Juliet.

Maybe I would have liked it better if it didn\u2019t call itself a thriller so I didn\u2019t have the expectation to be thrilled. Or maybe it would be more effective as a movie like Bridge of Spies where the music cues could do the work of building tension/excitement because the text was not doing that for me. In any case I was lost for large pieces of this. It felt like there was a lot of assumed knowledge about MI5 and the Cold War and I don\u2019t have any of that. Also Juliet as written was a weird cipher of sorts. I think I\u2019m supposed to gather that she is good at spy stuff but mostly things seem to happen to her. I just think there was a way for this to be written effectively but as is it was a muddle. Or maybe I\u2019m missing the point! I feel weird not liking it!"}, {"userName": "Joanna", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147402-joanna", "userReview": "Let me start by saying I won an ARC in a Goodreads Giveaway & who knows if anything noticeable will change before the book is released in September. Kate Atkinson is one of my favorites, but this one fell flat. I enjoyed the 1940 sections a lot, but the 1950 section in the middle really dragged. I liked the book, but it didn\u2019t live up to the high standards set by Case Histories and A God in Ruins."}, {"userName": "Lucio Vaccarello", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48273137-lucio-vaccarello", "userReview": "Kate Atkinson uses all of her considerable literary powers to wickedly spoof the byzantine, ruthless and insane world of espionage. The story is set in Britain circa 1940 with flash forwards to 1950 and the world of the BBC for reflection and a view of the changed world. The book describes the beginnings of MI5 as told through the eyes of Juliet Armstrong, a young women of 18, still recovering from the loss of her mother. She is naive and like most people of this age, searching for purpose and meaning to her life. Through pure chance Juliet is conscripted as an agent for the fledgling MI5 and tasked with covertly transcribing the treasonous plotting by a group of British Nazi sympathizers. She and the plotters are manipulated by Godfrey Toby, the Machiavellian and slippery architect of the new agency.Juliet learns about life, politics, love and the treachery of the human heart and mind. A tale well told with humor, wit and added dollops of the absurd. If you are a Kate Atkinson fan you will be in good spirits and chuckle throughout like I did.."}, {"userName": "Marilyn Smith", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47168381-marilyn-smith", "userReview": "England during WWII, young impressionable Juliet Armstrong is recruited into MI5. Juliet now Iris Armstorg has a shifting sense to her; acerbic or sweet, adoringly dense and too sharply shrewd. Perhaps she does her job too well? Set in decade chunks the novel shifts are like tides - always changing, always a little of center while teh days seem remarkably static. Atkinson's end notes are illuminating.A well written story"}, {"userName": "Megan Abbott", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1421166-megan-abbott", "userReview": "Kate Atkinson at her very best (well, that's practically all the time, but ...).

The main character is a young woman, Juliet, who typed up transcriptions of hidden microphone conversations, then became a spy herself, to me without much instruction and direction. The story time line changed between the two wars with gradual explanations of Juliet\u2019s daily life and spy interactions, ending briefly in her old age trying to remember it all. The author\u2019s writing style of revealing Juliet\u2019s hidden thoughts was likeable (read in parentheses). The thoughts were succinct responses that showed feelings and youthful ignorance in war time but over the years became very directive in who Juliet was, some thoughts quite grumpy and mean, sassy or flat, sometimes with humor. An ordinary perhaps dull, unmarried woman turned spy that would end up \u201csomewhere neutral - - somewhere no one could own her, where there were no sides but her own.\u201d Nothing is as simple as it seems, shines through. Kate Atkinson\u2019s novels all seem different from each other, this one included. Last - thanks to \u201cGiveaways\u201d for giving me this book!"}, {"userName": "Kiera O'Brien", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33659433-kiera-o-brien", "userReview": "I've been giving a lot of books five stars lately but as the world's biggest Kate Atkinson fangirl, I couldn't give Transcription anything else. I have never put down a World War II-set Atkinson title without then spending days feeling as though I'd had a genuine insight into what it was actually like to live through it. On top of that, her style is so incredibly readable, elegant, and no-one encapsulates that stream-of-consciousness effect with a character's thoughts within the prose like she does. Where's her Booker Prize?!"}, {"userName": "Char Jones", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69638075-char-jones", "userReview": "Pub Day can\u2019t come soon enough!! \ud83d\ude01"}, {"userName": "Ayelet Waldman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5447027-ayelet-waldman", "userReview": "Twisty and weird and wonderful, like all the best Kate Atkinson novels."}, {"userName": "Emily Sessa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/261100-emily-sessa", "userReview": "I received a copy of Transcription, Kate Atkinson's newest novel, prior to publication through a Goodreads giveaway (thanks GR!!). This was a great read, very much in the same vein as Life After Life and A God in Ruins, though it's most similar to LAL, following a female character through events that transpire primarily in 1940 and 1950. The prose is perfectly sharp, dry, and witty. It was part spy novel, part mystery, and part Atkinson's typical, wonderful exposition and exploration of one person's life and character, with much of what we learn about her coming from her interactions with other characters. I love eavesdropping on the frequently weary and sardonic inner monologues of Atkinson's heroines, and I enjoyed Juliet Armstrong just as much and perhaps even more than Ursula Todd. This felt like a le Carr\u00e9 novel told from a female perspective, with one of the innumerable \"girls\" (who, despite their importance to the British war effort, might as well be wallpaper in typical spy/mystery novels set in this period) finally getting her due and her own exciting story told. It was wonderful. I want more like this, preferably from Kate Atkinson."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3660107-amanda", "userReview": "Disclaimer: I won this in the Goodreads Giveaway. I love Kate Atkinson's writings a lot -- I know I converted lots of folks into being fans of Jackson (from her earlier series -- Started Early, Took My Dog is one of my favorite books)! Transcription starts with Juliet getting hit by a car in 1981. Her son rushes to her side, and we learn that he was born in Italy during her time there. Flashback to her work at the BBC in the 50s, and then eventually to her work during WWII, as a naive 19 year old. Then things get quite out of hand as she encounters the fifth column, gets embroiled in espionage, and this is interspliced with her time dealing with a rogue singer on the Beeb who accidentally sings F-bombs live on tape.I don't know that the bookend of the car accident was necessary, but it is incredibly short on both ends that hardly matters. I also appreciated the notes that Atkinson included at the end about her research methodology -- it was quite enlightening and I think she did justice to the heroic men and women who worked in clandestine services like transcribing tapes of double agents' work."}], "description": "Transcription is a bravura novel of extraordinary power and substance.
