Annie Butler goes missing; there is no physical description in the book but apparently Mrs Butler is extremely attractive, and not at all like the matronly woman described in the story who seems a bit overprotective. All the reader learns is that Annie's father is a \"perverted demon.\" As a matter of fact, the characters aren't very developed either; they have no essence. I didn't feel bad for Annie because I read about her for a page or two and then poof. The reader gets a brief, very brief, summary of why Annie and her mother moved to Cornwall, but they've managed to live in peace their for past ten years.....until. Now this is where the story gets boring and drags on. Reading about Charles Darrin at first piqued my curiosity, but then he became annoying and I wanted to figure out what was going on. The author focused too much on what the detectives were doing, which isn't interesting at all, instead of building the plot. I don't care about detectives, I want to know about the crazy person on the loose.  The book went from zero action to way too much action. In three sentences, after suffering through the rest of the book, Detective Inspector Jon Graham manages to find something on a VHS tape that no one else could have found, and recognized a distorted profile. This why the end seems like it was thrown together, because the perpetrator has been a citizen there, but he suddenly has mommy issues and flips out. The illness he suffered from was not explained in detail at all, and it should have been; that would have created some interest. After realizing who committed these crimes the book started dragging again until the end. The interesting part of the book was the knowledge about herbs, especially deadly thyme."}, {"userName": "Cheriee Weichel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2943211-cheriee-weichel", "userReview": "I enjoy reading mysteries, but I don't do scary at all. And let me warn you, this book is chilling. It's not my kind of book at all at all.It is a testament to the quality of Nolen's writing that not only did I finish it, once started, I couldn't not finish it, no matter how horrific it became. (I do admit to taking breaks from it to calm down)One quiet Sunday morning in a village in Cornwall, a ten year old girl, Annie Butler, is abducted. Her kidnapper, Charles, is serial killer who believes that drinking young girls' blood will make him young again. That premise alone makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Yet it gets worse. Nolan's omniscient narrator takes us inside the heads of the main characters. It's this that makes it disturbing. The narrative weaves its way into the impossible logic of the psychotic Charles, then wends it's way through imprisoned Annie's terror, stays a while with her mother Ruth's frantic panic, and on to DI Jon Graham's desperate sleuthing to find Annie before it is too late. Round and about, each glimpse inside the individual characters' realities ratchets the tension and suspense up. I won't spoil this for you, but I admit that this is one of those books where midway through, I had to read enough of the end so that I could go back and finish the book without suffering from apoplexy. If you are a reader of thrillers, then this book is for you. The plot is riveting. The characters are fully developed. This book puts the reader on the Cornish coast, enmeshed in village life and inside the heads of its inhabitants. It isn't for my elementary school readers, so I'll send my hard copy of the book to our feeder high school. I hope The Dry, the other of Nolan's books I have, is less traumatic.

You are kept guessing who it might be, and there are a number of suspects woven into the plot.Nolan managed the multiple point of views well, allowing the reader a peek into key characters\u2019 perspectives by clearly illustrating their unique thought patterns. She managed to show the antagonist without giving enough clues to easily surmise the identity. However, there were two short passages where the story switched to omniscient narrator, which felt a bit disjointed. Nevertheless, the characters were all described very well \u2013 unique quirks and all. Spots of humour brought interesting insights into each character\u2019s personality, effectively creating a diverse cast.

The plot twists and turns kept me guessing. I had a few ideas of who the kidnapper was, and I did end up being correct with one of my guesses, but it wasn't the person that I actually expected it to be, so that was interesting.As an American, I could totally relate to Ruth's little slips from the British language and I would smile at Annie's corrections of her in the beginning of the story. After Annie was taken and could not translate for me, I found myself on more than one occasion being confused by a certain British term or phrase, and I would have to reread for context to understand. It was actually sort of fun. I also adored Ruth's mother from Texas, she was a hoot.Overall I felt it was a good story and it ended the way I wanted it to end.I would recommend this book for people who like mysteries and suspense.

There were times when I did catch my mind wandering from the story but not often. It did keep me guessing.

But the idyllic setting loses its charm when her daughter Annie goes missing while playing with her friend on the beach. Has Ruth's past caught up with her or is something far more sinister going on? Ruth struggles with whether or not she should come clean about her true identity, which could get her deported because, as an American citizen, she is living there illegally.This mystery crime thriller had me by the throat from the very first pages and wouldn't let go. The panic Ruth feels when she can't find Annie is palpable in the first few chapters and the tension only grows from there as we get to see a cast of interesting characters. A cop, Jon Graham, who's undercover on another assignment is certain this other case won't interfere with his own, but he's soon sucked into Ruth's plight as she searches for her daughter. The narrator brings us into the points-of-view of various characters and moves smoothly from head to head, even bringing us into Annie's horror as she has to deal with a madman. A few twists and turns were thrown in along the way to a heart-pounding conclusion.

The book really picked up about halfway in and the mystery/suspense was great! At the beginning I felt like the killer's issues were a bit overdone but towards the end I felt like it all came together well. I kept jumping from 3-4 suspects right up until the end and the killer ended up being one of the suspects that was high on my list but the mystery was well done and doubts were planted about a lot of the main characters! I loved the herb element in the book and how the killer used different herbs to symbolize things.I thought that the book could have used a touch more editing - there were some minor typos, some clunky sentences and a few paragraphs throughout the book that didn't seem to fit or make sense but nothing that majorly impacted my enjoyment of the book.

As the mystery of his identity is peeled back in layers, the bond between Ruth and Annie, and later between Ruth and the lead investigator, emerge as counterweights to the killer\u2019s evil purposes. There is a lot to interest a mystery reader in this book. The author captures perfectly the atmosphere of the small English town, its inhabitants, and its police. The characters are authentic, likeable, interesting, and sometimes eccentric. For me, the blood-thirsty serial killer is the show-stopper.

With any murder mystery, there is required a higher character number than other genres, because the reader needs to figure out who did it. The characters were defined, individual, and I had no problem remembering who was who. I came close to figuring out the identity of the killer, but was led down another twist, and began to doubt my suspicions. Although we know him as \"Charles,\" we have little to go on other than that he is a mentally disturbed individual, driven by hatred towards his mother. Deadly Thyme is set in a rural Cornish village, with beautiful scenery. The story begins with the abduction of Annie Butler, daughter of Ruth, a Texas woman, hiding out in Perrins Point. Ruth is trying to leave the past behind her, unfortunately, Charles, a man haunted by his past, sees in Ruth the reflection of his mother. When he abducts her daughter, Ruth is thrown into a nightmare.This is a well written, often tense story."}, {"userName": "Anthony Hulse", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21750394-anthony-hulse", "userReview": "Incredible and enjoyable read!Although I\u2019m not a prolific reader, this book will stay with me long after I\u2019ve written this review. Rebecca invites us into a seemingly picturesque and quaint village in Cornwall, but the abduction of Annie Butler, a young girl shocks the locality. Detective Inspector Jon Graham arrives in Cornwall to investigate a possible corrupt senior detective. He is unconsciously drawn towards the abduction case; his attraction to the victim\u2019s mother, Ruth one of the reasons for his involvement. As Graham becomes infatuated with the investigation, the plot throws up a series of colourful, yet strange characters, who subsequently becomes suspects. The abduction is then linked to a number of unsolved murders in Cornwall.The story flows wonderfully and the words are expertly crafted by this truly gifted writer. Her locations were so descriptive and creative, and the dialogue was magnificent. A whodunit that keeps the reader guessing the identity of the warped killer until the final pages. Frightening, moving, and disturbing, this book will captivate you.

Finn for Readers\u2019 FavoriteDeadly Thyme is an engrossing mystery novel by R.L. Nolen. Former Texan Ruth Butler relocates to Perrin's Point, England, after an empowered break from her husband in a bid to protect Annie, her beloved daughter. A decade passes and Ruth and Annie settle into their new lives, until the fateful day when Annie suddenly vanishes. Unable to investigate openly and risk deportation, Ruth enlists the help of Detective Inspector Jon Graham who is in the area on an unrelated case. The search for Annie leads the duo to gruesome finds and sinister plots, not least of which is the connection to a bizarre, disturbed soul who fixates on Ruth as a new incarnation of his deceased mother. Fans of small town dramas are sure to be sucked into this little Cornish village, with its creepy caves and bodies washing up on the beach. R.L. Nolen crafts a suspenseful mystery with superb prose, and I was delighted by the way the villain\u2019s herbaceous clues connected with the novel\u2019s title. Flowing expertly and with diligent detectives and unexpected plot twists, I daresay that Nolen is my modern day Agatha Christie, long searched for and finally found. Deadly Thyme is an incredibly compelling read with realistic emotional impact, descriptive attention to detail, and a portrayal of unsettling true evil that will stay with me for quite some time yet. I absolutely devoured this book, and I\u2019d highly recommend it to mystery readers looking for dark drama, well crafted characters and a genuinely surprising and original plot line."}, {"userName": "GymGuy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5850785-gymguy", "userReview": "I picked this one up on a whim. The story looked intriguing and the reviews positive. There are not many books on GR for this author, so I don't have much of a perspective on what books she writes.I will say that this book has a very lovely style. The writing is highly descriptive and flows well. The premise is rather dark and cruel, which I was willing to accept. It was charged with emotion. However, as a detective novel it falls very short. I felt that Graham was rather clueless for most of the book. As a guy, I also felt that there was way too much emotion, and I got tired of all the hand-wringing. Not trying to be sexist here, but judging by the man/woman ratio of reviewers and also my own opinion, this is probably better aimed at the woman audience rather than a guy who likes more of the high-action stuff.Four stars for style, two stars for bad execution as a cop/detective novel."}, {"userName": "Beth Roberts", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7294575-beth-roberts", "userReview": "True rating: 2.5This is an overly ambitious book. At 40o pages long, it easily should have been cut in editing by at least a 100 pages. At just over the halfway point, it began to drag terribly. It is a first novel, and unfortunately, that was obvious. I really wanted to like this book and I didn't *dislike* it. The author has some promise. The ebook , though definitely in need of tighter editing, is beautifully presented. The author and the publishing house are apparently both in Houston, TX, where I have lived my entire life. So, there was an element of local solidarity playing into my desire both to read and like this book. That's why it was rather strange she set the book in Cornwall, England, but as I love a good English mystery, I was good to go with the re-located Texas heroine. From there, however, it just didn't materialize into its promise.Ms. Nolen did a very good job with consistency of place and research. The characters came across, however, as just that - characters. They never took on a life of their own. They remained rather flat throughout. As I said, this book stretched out with a LOT of filler. For instance, my favorite example of this, where the lead male character is in the midst of a major kidnapping investigation, we get this astute observation:\"He was very impressed with the comfort of this B&B with its modern appointments and spacious, brightly lit rooms. He could sit back, relax, and really think. A shower with hot water, what a delightful concept. What would they come up with next? He dressed and went searching.\"So. . .what? Because I'm going to be booking a stay through Expedia for a fictional B&B?There were a lot of passages like the one above.And then, this astute observation by a 10-year-old hostage:\"The worst thing about sitting chained to a wall was the nothingness. . .Then came the nothingness, because nothing she did did any good, so she had nothing to do.\"Aside from awkward sentence construction, also liberally encountered throughout the book, the point of the above sentence is?And this:Despite the tide in some circles and efforts to explain evil away with platitudes and reason, no one could explain it away.\" Again, awkwardly put, but. . .DUH! Any kid could have told you that!And perhaps my favorite of all. . .again, while in the midst of a kidnapping and now multiple homicide investigation we have this necessary and time-consuming observation by the main male character:\"Take the super in his role as a liason between policing agencies: he worked hand in hand with Policy Authority Inspectors, HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, HM Inspectorate of Court Administration, HM Inspectorate of Probation, and HM Inspectorate of Prisons in their process of drawing up a joint inspection scheme and associated framework. . .Bakewell had become the hand watching the hand watching the hand of various agencies of police where they intersected with the public.\"WOW! I really hope if anyone I love is ever kidnapped and murdered, the investigators will (a) have already read the manual for chain of command and protocol, and (b) if they haven't, will not stop to jot the summary treatise in their notes! OMG - get on with it!!! There's at least 5 people dead and a girl chained to a cave wall somewhere and the author gives us this??!!Also, the title promises a lot more herbal involvement than there is. The main detective knows a lot of herbal lore (okay), but it never really ties it to the perpetrator. A lot of things are not really explained. As one reviewer noted, the killer suddenly developed Mommy issues and whacked out.Well, not exactly - the Mommy issues were pretty well laid out of 300 pages before the final whack-out, but yeah. Even though the ending was abrupt, it still took another 50 pages to deal with the mental case and get everyone safely home. Even the ending, the typical love-story wrapup - took up pages and pages with this: \"Blast it, woman! I've loved you since I first laid eyes on you.\"She covered her mouth with a hand to stop the wave of joy the bubbled up.He stuttered, \"So. . .um. . .I know I haven't proven myself to you.\" (insert: except where he's defied the brass, conquered his claustrophobia, been hit over the head a couple times, crawled through nasty-ass tunnels and caves to look for the daughter she swore was still alive, believed her when she insisted her daughter was alive and no one else did, physically saved the daughter and led her to safety, etc., etc.)\"What's to prove?\" She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed his gorgeous lips.\"Awwww. Vomit. And guess what? That's STILL not the end. There's 8 more pages after that!Also, a final note, because an overly long book deserves an overly long review:I'm afraid the author also set up for a sequel. The killer's body was never recovered. I hope that's not really a spoiler. How else could a book like this end? Or not end?"}, {"userName": "Michele", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27841679-michele", "userReview": "Overall, this was a pretty good book.

Nolen\u2019s \u201cDeadly Thyme,\u201d I will not talk about the story line because it is documented by others. Instead, I will talk about the author\u2019s writing and style. Because of my expertise, I am interested in Deadly Thyme\u2019s writing mechanics including character development, language, and length and development of chapters. However, before I begin my review, I would like to say this genre is not my usual type of read. I was introduced to DT because of a friend. It is my desire to support Houston\u2019s local authors as I\u2019m a native Texan and current Houston resident.The content and story line of DT is certainly timely. This is illustrative from the daily local and world news events and from the popularity of the pursuit of immortality TV. For me and because of its length, the book was not a sit-down-and-read-it-in-one-sitting book. I took my time to read it carefully to study and digest its contents. The book is an excellent read from a content and mechanics standpoint. The book is also an excellent read from a creative standpoint. I would recommend it without reservation. After this first introduction to the author, it is my intent to read more of the author\u2019s books, if not all of them. Now, for my comments. The title \u201cDeadly Thyme\u201d was intriguing but a good choice. The title piqued my interest and I kept it in my mind until the reason for the title was revealed. The dedication was to the author\u2019s mother. I\u2019m always interested in the book\u2019s dedications because, if read carefully, you can learn about the author. In the Acknowledgements, I learned more about the author and some of the book\u2019s authenticity and development. The location and some of the characters of the book are based on actual places and composites of people. The book was divided into weeks and I especially liked the way the author used the week sequences, Time Is, Time Was, and Time\u2019s Past. The length of the book was 394 pages. The chapters were approximately 7-10 pages each and there were approximately 20 chapters in each Time sequence. I did not set out to read casually or quickly; I began my read as a study. Reading only a chapter at one sitting allowed me to reflect on what I was reading and what I had just read. I did not rush to the end \u201ccheating\u201d myself of the author\u2019s journey to find the perpetrator. I read from front to end unhurriedly and with careful attention to the words used by the author and the words used by the book\u2019s characters. The characters in DT are totally believable. As the events unfolded, I began to feel I knew each character and their actions and language gave insight into their personality. The language used by the characters was also believable. The local English dialect of Cornwall was used sparingly and for purpose but not overused. The \u201cTexas\u201d dialect of one of the characters was also used sparingly and to enhance the character\u2019s personality.As a grammarian, I look at words, word usage, and punctuation. I am impressed with the author in the way words were used in descriptions, in characters\u2019 language, and in dialog between the characters. There were a few times my vocabulary was increased due to the author\u2019s vocabulary but not to the point of being disruptive.DT is a book written for adults because of its content. I would not recommend DT for teens but mature young adults (age 18 on), I feel, could read without consequence if the book\u2019s premise was known beforehand. The book is an investigative crime novel with crimes having been committed in the past and with a crime currently being investigated. Final comments: Because of the author\u2019s attention to detail, I believe it would be possible to enter a room and be able to identify each character by observing their physical description, actions, and language. Additionally, because of the way the story line unfolds, I could easily envision DT as an actual movie. The book is well written and I would not hesitate to recommend it. I give this book an A+!

Her crime thriller novel hooked me early on with the skillful use of simile that captured vivid images of seaside craggy cliffs and the secrets that lay hidden in the fictitious English village of Perrins Point set in Cornwall England. For example, I liked lines such as \"Cornwall was a rugged triangle of man-tunneled rock, like a hardened wedge of Swiss cheese\"; and \"Lawlessness permeated Cornwall's history like brandy in a Christmas pudding\u201d. Rebecca also uses her skillful pen to deliver, with frightening clarity, the bone-chilling terror of being in tight spaces that scared me to death! An interesting cast-of-characters moves the drama along; some of them are funny, some are a little mysterious and one is downright creepy. Every once in a while, one of the characters will deliver an unexpected zinger of comic relief. For me, Deadly Thyme conjured up images of the BBC\u2019s Doc Martin, Colin Dexter\u2019s Inspectors Morse and Lewis, as well as Stephen King\u2019s suspense novels. I think Rebecca is a talented storyteller and I look forward to her next book.

It really works.\u201c Deadly Thyme is a finely crafted mystery/thriller I recommend highly."}, {"userName": "Susan Tarr", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21715194-susan-tarr", "userReview": "A most compelling read. I would have to say it\u2019s the best I have read in some time. And what a great voice. Nolen\u2019s eloquent writing and jam-packed descriptions of the old English villages, of Cornwall, Devon, and Wales drew me right in. The colloquialisms, and, of course, the plots within plots, held me there.This story is not as simple as it may first appear. As in her other book, The Dry, Nolen carries the story along at a steady pace.We first have Annie, the little girl who has disappeared. Sure, her shoe is found on the foot of a dead child. But is that child Annie? The mother insists it is not. So we have two missing children? Yet no one has claimed the other.Annie\u2019s mother is living under a false name. So what or who is she running from?And which of the villagers know the full story, and who\u2019s not telling the whole truth? This is a comprehensive read, a real psychological thriller, and deserves readers who appreciate those combined quality. I know I did. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Linda Watkins", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19287077-linda-watkins", "userReview": "\"Deadly Thyme\" is a very intense, thrilling read. From the opening pages when we meet little Annie Butler and witness her abduction, to the roller coaster ride of an ending, Ms. Nolen keeps the reader teetering on the edge of her seat!Set in a sleepy seaside village in England, we are introduced to an eccentric cast of characters, many of who could be Annie's abductor. Clues are dropped here and there and I kept wavering back and forth between the possible suspects, not knowing until the very end who the real villain was.The writing is crisp and tight and the story progresses effortlessly. The villain of the piece is one of the most memorable and nasty that I have ever encountered in literature. The reader's heart goes out to poor Annie, caught in his nefarious and deadly grasp.This is one of the best mysteries I have read in a long time and I am hopeful that Ms. Nolen will bring us back to Cornwall in the near future to let us in on the future adventures of Inspector Jon Graham! Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Marjorie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30147296-marjorie", "userReview": "Given To Me For An Honest ReviewWhen I began reading this book I thought it was just another book. Was I ever wrong. This book is such a page turner it's unbelievable. Once you begin to read it you will not be able to put it done until you finish it. It is about a woman and her daughter who are being watched by a person unknown to them. He sees Ruth (the mother) and believes it is his mother. He decides he must kill her. He takes her daughter without actually planning to. His \"mother\" continuously speaks to him and he continues to argue with her. During the search for Annie (the daughter) several other girls' bodies are found. Other murders are committed also. There are so many twists and turns in this story that to tell you more I would ruin your reading of this book. It is truly a HAVE TO read. I gave it 5 stars but it really needs more than 10. I highly recommend this book to everyone. I look forward to seeing more works by R.L. Nolen."}, {"userName": "Jan Raymond", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28460527-jan-raymond", "userReview": "This one will be keeping me up at nights. I have two daughters and R.L. Nolen has very insightfully captured the heartbreak, misery, hopelessness and despair that a mother feels if anything happens to a child. Ruth Butler has her secrets but it seems like everyone in the sleepy town that she lives in, has one too. Into this web of secrets arrives Jon Graham on his own mission that has nothing to do with the events happening in the town. But he gets drawn into the mystery surrounding the disappearance of Ruth's daughter, and ends up helping the very person he has been sent to investigate.Brilliantly woven, with a twist at every turn, the author has a dark streak and empathy and understanding of human emotions which she is able to portray skillfully in this page turner. I love pshycho thrillers and for those out there who like a suspense filled book, I would recommend this."}, {"userName": "Demelza Carlton", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13234736-demelza-carlton", "userReview": "A brilliant mystery thriller that I didn't want to put down. Switching effortlessly from the victim to the kidnapper to the detective, Ms Nolen spins a captivating tale. A delightful balance of action and description, evoking the Cornwall coast just as clearly as the psychosis in the kidnapper's mind. While the clues are laid out as to who he is and where he keeps his victims, it's not until he revealed himself that I was certain it was him. So, yes, thrilling from start to finish. Read this one if you want to immerse yourself in a chilling story set on a chilly, rugged English coastline...but only if you have the time to read the whole book in one sitting, or I guarantee you'll be up late wanting to finish it. Five stars, no question."}, {"userName": "Tony Burnett", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17342048-tony-burnett", "userReview": "This complex little mystery, written by an American but set in Britain, features quaint and complex British characters. The story takes you through a setting that you will long to visit, a small hamlet on the coast near Cornwall. An American woman illegally in the country to avoid an abusive ex-husband has a daughter who disappears virtually into thin air. The convoluted plot features quirky characters, many of whom you will grow to love. My favorite is Tavy, a crotchety old hermit who wonders the hills at night with a huge ominous black dog. The story contains enough red herrings for a pot luck dinner but Nolan ties up everything neatly at the end. It's a fascinating well-written mystery that will keep you turning pages."}, {"userName": "Bookish", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12313605-bookish", "userReview": "**I received this book from Goodreads as an advanced read**I would rate this book a 3.5. I am one of those people who enjoy trying to figure out who the villain is before the story ends. I had it narrowed down to two characters, but kept going back and forth before the final reveal. I loved that the fact that it wasn't very obvious! There were parts of the book that seemed a bit slow, but nothing so major that I ever wanted to stop reading it. In contrast, I felt there were times more detail could have been provided, such as explaining why Charles Darrin practiced the rituals he did, more character development on Tavish, et cetera. Overall, it was an enjoyable book, and I would definitely read more by the author."}, {"userName": "Gay Yellen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24646995-gay-yellen", "userReview": "A peaceful English seaside village is wracked by an American child's abduction.
