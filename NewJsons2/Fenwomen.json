It falls within the tradition of oral history and concerns the lives of women in the remote fenland village of Isleham. The fens are a very flat area of Eastern England, the part in Lincolnshire I am familiar with, this area in Cambridgeshire, much less so. This book also has the merit of being the first book published by virago in 1975.It is a series of interviews with village women split into chapters about girlhood, school, marriage, work, religion, politics, recreation, outsiders and old age. The edition I have was published in 2009 with an updated introduction and some stunning photography. Mary Chamberlain was a member of the Women\u2019s Report Collective and she had moved to Isleham in 1972. The idea was to look at the lives of women living in a fairly remote rural area and produce a feminist version of Akenfield. At the time it was felt that women\u2019s history really did not exist and feminist historians had to pursue new courses and use new methods.The result is a fascinating picture of the life of rural women in the early twentieth century. There is no rural idyll here; the women describe the poverty and isolation, the lack of opportunity in a harsh landscape. It is an excellent piece of work and if you are interested in this sort of history, a must read. Chamberlain lets the women speak for themselves and pulls the whole together very expertly."}, {"userName": "Kathy Piselli", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5081147-kathy-piselli", "userReview": "Wikipedia says this was \"the first book published by Virago Press in 1975, and pioneered the use of oral history in the study of women\u2019s history\" and I'm not sure that can be true. But Virago published some cutting edge books. The author's notes explaining terms she thought needed explaining then would need a refresher as time marches on and even more of what the fenwomen talk about passes into obscurity. Still the wholesale, practically unedited recording of the musings of ordinary people provide such fantastic fodder for understanding a lifestyle and time period. Chamberlain lets the women tell their own stories, but introduces sections with observations of her own. For example she compares girlhood of the past to girlhood now. Then, children grew up fast and were sent to work early, whereas now \"no work exists for children\" - it is mostly illegal. Boys are \"left to play\" but girls are \"little Mummies\" at four with \"plastic babies and toy hoovers\". Girls get makeup and boyfriends early, even before they are teens. \"Childhood for girls has not changed. It still ends early\"."}, {"userName": "Leonie", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6070023-leonie", "userReview": "Thanks to my friend Liz who loaned this to me. Interesting to hear the thoughts and experiences of these women living in a Fenland village, 40 years ago. How restrictive life was for many of them, compared to what I experience now. I've tried to figure out which village it was, as I live in Ely (which is mentioned a lot as the nearest town/city) but failed miserably. I'd love to read an update, on the lives of the younger women, if you're reading, Mary Chamberlain!"}, {"userName": "Wealhtheow", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76129-wealhtheow", "userReview": "After living in an East Anglian village, Gislea, for a few years, Chamberlain wrote a book about life there. It is told primarily through interviews with the women. It is a heartbreaking, enthralling tale of desperate poverty, generation long prejudices, and familial warmth. Most of the interviews talked about the back breaking labor, lack of intellectual opportunities, and loneliness of living in the fen. This was written in the 1970s, and so many of the subjects remember back to life at the turn of the 19th century."}, {"userName": "Tamra Karl", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24597237-tamra-karl", "userReview": "I do like oral histories - it's interesting to see the great variety of views that's often missed in a more generalized traditional history. However, it became rather tedious to read the sometimes ramblings of the women recorded in this book."}, {"userName": "Trine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1888914-trine", "userReview": "Essential reading for anyone interested in women's history in general and the history of the Fens in particular."}], "description": "An oral history of women in a fenland village.", "title": "Fenwomen", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10388056-fenwomen", "average": 3.89, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1356468655l/10388056.jpg", "reviews": 6, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/258029.Mary_Chamberlain", "name": "Mary Chamberlain"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4625549.Justin_Partyka", "name": "Justin Partyka"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Sociology", "Environment", "History"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10388056-fenwomen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4248891-fenwomen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4287183-fenwomen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25278972-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29938349-de-pourpre-et-de-soie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9513220-old-wives-tales", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37908238-la-modista-de-dover-street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2702829-writing-lives"]}
