I have had the Audible edition sitting on my shelf for months, if not years. Finally, I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, this book ended up being a disappointment for me. It ended up being kind of \"meh\". I just couldn't ever connect with the characters or the story. I'm beginning to think that I need to stick to Karina Halle's dark romance/dark erotica. I love many of her other books that fall in those sub-genres. However, every book of hers that I've tried outside of those sub-genres has been a let down for me. Maybe this is related to my expectations for the author, based on her other works that I've loved. Who knows? What I do know is that this one didn't work for me.The heroine, Perry Palomino, is a young twenty-something that works a dead-end job and seems to lack much of a social life. She is trying to prove herself responsible after having problems with drug use and mental health issues in her teen years. She seems to have gone from one extreme to another, going from out of control to pretty boring.Dex Foray, the \"hero\", is mostly just a douchebag. He rubbed me wrong right from the start. I love an \"a$$hole\" leading male as much as the next girl, but somewhere along the way there has to be something appealing about the guy thrown in there to keep me hoping. There has to be a glimpse of a redeeming quality provided every now and again. Unfortunately, that just didn't happen in this book until it was way too late. He remained an insulting, demeaning a-hole for pretty much the entire book. I couldn't stand him!These two cross paths one night at an old, abandoned lighthouse that is owned by Perry's uncle. The lighthouse is rumored to be haunted. When Perry and Dex have a very creepy experience, it opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Perry shares the experience on her sister's blog and it goes viral. Next thing she knows, Dex is proposing that the two of them do a \"ghost hunters\" web show. It sounds like a nice break from her boring day to day life, so Perry agrees.Before long, Perry and Dex are traveling around together, visiting haunted places. Along the way, there are a few spine-tingling encounters. They keep running across an old \"clown\" lady that delivers cryptic messages and forecasts for their futures. What hung with me more than anything else was irritation with Dex. I kept wondering why he had to be such a degrading jackass to Perry. More importantly, I couldn't figure out why she kept putting up with his nastiness. Sure, he was supposed to be hot, but that was no excuse. If I had to hear one more snide comment about how NOT hot Perry was, or how his girlfriend was so beautiful, I was going to throw up or punch something. I got it. Perry was nothing special in a superficial way. Why did it have to be brought up every other minute?In the end, there was a twist or two. Admittedly, I didn't see them coming. However, I'm not sure if that is because it was especially surprising...or if it was due to the fact that I had kind of tuned out a lot of this story. This is one of those times when I find myself in the minority. I didn't love this story like I expected to. It ended up just being kind of \"meh\". In fairness, I was in a bit of a reading rut at the time and there weren't too many books that appealed to me when I started this one."}, {"userName": "Dd", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9444787-dd", "userReview": "Hello Readers!!\n  Do you like to watch scary movies with your lights switched off, hugging your pillows to yourself,wrapped up in your favourite blanket??All the while jumping at every little sound and looking all around you???\nIf yes,then grab your pillows and blankets and welcome to the Darkhouse......An \n  EXPERIMENT IN TERROR\n is about to be conducted!!!--------------------------------------------------Now let's meet with them who are conducting it.....\n  Readers,what would you do if you stumble upon your greatest nightmare??\nHmmmmm......let me think what I would do.\n  Run.Fast.In the opposite direction.\nBut not our Perry.Oh no!!She has always felt as if she had been born to do something special.Something different.Something exciting.Atleast more exciting than being a receptionist in an advertising firm.A calling perhaps?And then one fateful day,she meets with Dex.And then everything changes.Lines between real and unreal get blurred.Dreams overlap with reality.They realize what terror means.Real terror.One which makes it difficult to breathe,makes you go numb,makes you break out in cold sweat,drives you insane.Where do they meet?In the Darkhouse.The Darkhouse,property of her uncle,is a forgotten and dilapidated lighthouse.Question:- Is it haunted?And what is this experiment they are conducting?Is it bigger and more dangerous than both of them anticipate?Find it out!!-------------------------------------------------------Now to be blunt....Both of them,Perry and Dex are \n  stupid,reckless,impulsive,and bat-shit crazy.\nI kid you not.Seriously,no sane person will ever try the things they did.I guess you can call them brave too,but I prefer to go with crazy.So these utterly crazy and impossible people are our hero and heroine.And I adored them!!I guess that makes me crazy too,but I never claimed otherwise.As for the story,it was intense,gripping,fast-paced,and yes,let's not forget creepy.And what I loved the most?Perry made me laugh and smile,even during some of the creepiest moments.The only thing which bugged me was the climax.The instances one after the other were not clear.Maybe the books next in the series will help me clarify my doubts.Anyway,this book is recommended.As for this couple....they rock!!Dex and Perry.That's all for now,Readers.Ta-Ta!!Have funnn...."}, {"userName": "Georgia \u2665 Team Dex \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9138738-georgia-team-dex", "userReview": "\"Amazing.

Too good to be true.\"\n5 Amazing-Karina-Halle Supernatural Stars\"How come you aren\u2019t afraid?\" \"Because I find life to be scarier than death.\"Horror was never more exciting... A dark, twisted, and gothic read. An Alfred Hitchcock movie scenario. Sadly, he is dead and can't make it another masterpiece. Karina Halle has nothing to envy and with this series she firmly finds her place between the masters of horror and thrillers, amongst my all-time favourites, Dean Koontz and Stephen King.Forgotten in the cold Oregon coast, abandoned and alone stands a Lighthouse.The setting for an Experiment in Terror.\n  It sat there forgotten and lightless, a darkhouse overlooking the sea.\nPerry PalominoOur heroine is an amazing, one-of a kind, totally relatable twenty-two years old girl. Never, was a heroine so appealing to me... She has a degree in advertising but she is wasting away being a receptionist because she doesn't realise just how unique she is.All her life she had weird dreams, visions and imaginary friends. She struggled, she failed. She used drugs, she abused herself and therapists managed to convince her that she is crazy and they made her forget.But now her nightmares are spilling all over her reality and her imaginary friends are haunting her day-time. \n  \"Somehow, by dealing with the dead, I had never felt so alive.\"\nAnd they aren't going away...Declan \"Dex\" Foray\n  \"Because sometimes I lie, Perry. We all lie, even you, but not everyone is brave enough to admit it.\"\nThe half of Perry's lost soul. Psychotic, insane, arrogant, sexy, the cameraman and producer of several webseries takes an interest in the morbid history of the Lighthouse and Perry's innocent \"charm\". They gamble and they become partners. In horror and in fate. Because what they don't realise, is that they are meant to save each other.Sexual tension and infatuation take a whole new meaning as these two exchange words, promises and blood. They are two sides of the same coin and they can't part...They weren't believers, but when the truth is staring at you, you can't help but face it.Fascinating and twisting, snarky and sarcastic, this story engages all your senses with a sort of manic attention to detail. The weather and the surroundings become a tool in the author's capable hands to manipulate our feelings and blur the lines between normal and paranormal. The words are turning into a B-movie around you and just like Alice you can't help but fall... deeper and deeper in the Rabbit Hole...A highly recommended read! Thank you Fathima and Lucia for \"nudging\" me into it. Karina Halle has created an exciting world that I can't help but admire. Already bought all the next books, even the novellas.

With that in mind...Darkhouse isn't high-brow literature, it's not going to change the world (yet), and yeah, there are one or two typos in the book. But, considering it's the first book in the series, it is what is. A \"pilot episode\" that introduces two characters, Perry Palomino and Dex Foray, who will vex, challenge and intrigue you from this book onwards. Darkhouse has some tense, creepy moments - not only with regards to the supernatural (including a \"dead\" lighthouse creeper...er, keeper), but between Perry and Dex. So about those characters? Perry can be a bit annoying at times - she's off in her head a lot, but who isn't? And she's obviously smitten with Dex in the worst way possible. I think we've all been in her shoes, where you just want someone to smack some sense into her. Luckily, her younger sister Ada does that job in her own emo way. Perry is pretty much what most women were like at 22. Struggling with what the hell she's supposed to do with her life, and facing outdated expectations in this competitive world. I think of Perry as the \"Everygirl.\" Everyone should be able to relate to her in some way.And Dex. Well, he can be a bit of an ass, he's a definite weirdo, and has some pretty dark secrets he hopes will never see the light of day. But god damn it if he doesn't get under your skin. I heart him.The pacing of the book can be slow at times, but it's always been more of a character study than an action-packed potboiler. Luckily, it picks up as it goes along and the book in general isn't very long. You could finish it in a couple of days.I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes interesting, relatable characters, the supernatural, scary stuff, and a book series that only gets better over time. It's kind of like a younger version of The X-Files (particularly with the Scully and Mulder working relationship).I'd rate this book PG-13 for scares and swears.Oh right, and obviously I wrote the book, so take the review with a grain of salt :)"}, {"userName": "David - proud Gleeman in Branwen's adventuring party", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10923016-david---proud-gleeman-in-branwen-s-adventuring-party", "userReview": "By mixing in elements of horror, humor, romance, and action, this Experiment In Terror is a complete success!Working at a job she can't stand and living with a family who doesn't understand her, Perry Palomino is having trouble finding her place in the world. Maybe that's why she finds herself drawn to other things that don't quite belong in this world as well. Shadowy horrors invade her dreams, and a haunted lighthouse beacons her. When her investigation into the strange lighthouse leads her to wannabe ghost-hunter Dex Foray, the two of them decide to pool their talents in order to learn and document the secrets of the supernatural. But soon Perry isn't sure which is more dangerous...the ghosts that are stalking her, or the man who's helping her chase them!This horror-movie fan had a lot of fun reading \"Darkhouse\"...so much so, that I will even be bestowing upon it awards from three of my favorite horror movies of all time...\"The Ring\" award - for putting \"terror\" over \"horror\"!I've seen all the \"Halloween\" movies (although, why would anyone sit through them all, they're all pretty much the same movie), all the \"Nightmare On Elm Street\" movies (seriously, what the hell is wrong with me) and all the \"Friday the 13th\" movies (I've wasted my life), yet NONE of them even came close to freaking me out as much as the scene where Samara crawls out of the TV in \"The Ring\"! Karina Halle takes a similar approach. Rather than drowning the reader with blood and gore, Halle uses chilling prose and a creepy atmosphere to make us afraid of what may happen next. The first half of the book is more dedicated to character development (although there are enough eerie events to keep the terror flowing even then), but the creep factor really picks up in the second half! To give too much away would be a disservice to the reader, as the scarier moments are much more effective when they're experienced first hand (try telling someone who hasn't seen The Ring, \"Then this freaky chick crawls out of a TV!\"....just not the same as actually seeing it). But I can reveal that Karina Halle manages to infuse elements of fear and dread without ever resorting to schlock tactics (something that even Thomas Harris was incapable of doing by the 3rd Hannibal Lecter book) , and that takes true talent! Oh, and speaking of Hannibal...\"Silence of the Lambs\" award - for mesmerizing leads!Clarice and Hannibal were certainly not your typical on-screen couple (although, if they were, I might start watching a lot more rom-coms). Likewise, Perry is hardly the kind of lead you usually find in a young-adult novel. She's not glamorous, she isn't the best at anything, and forget about love-triangles, she'd be happy just to be part of a love-duo! But she is funny, intelligent, and sensitive, and her personality makes her more endearing than even Katniss Everdeen ever was. Halle strikes a perfect balance in characterizing Perry. Perry's insecurities are just enough to make her sympathetic, but not enough to get on the readers nerves. Perry's narration is often laugh-out-loud funny, but it's her more tender moments that really resonate with the audience. Also, she is the perfect counterpart for the much-more-confident but not-quite-as-sensitive Dex. While he dies provide much humor of his own, there's a darker edge to Dex, and the more we learn about him, the less we're sure Perry should be working with him. Perry and Dex are both enthralling in their own way, and they play off of each other beautifully. And that perfect chemistry leads us to...\"Scream\" award - for giving us cool stuff to watch even when scary things aren't happening! When I remember my favorite parts of \"Scream\", I very rarely think of the actual creepy stuff. Instead, I remember all the hilarious parts, especially when the characters kept deconstructing the \"rules\" of surviving a horror movie...one of my favorites being when Jamie Kennedy survived the events of the first movie (sorry for the spoiler of a 15-year-old movie) and announced, \"I never thought I'd be so happy to be a virgin!\" Likewise, \"Darkhouse\" is often at its best when scary things AREN'T going on! The heartwarming bond that Perry builds with her younger sister. The hilarious shenanigans of Perry's drunken cousins. This book works on so many levels, there were times I got so caught up in Perry's day-to-day life, I almost forgot that this was a horror novel! That's not to say that there aren't plenty of scares, but rather that the book manages to be equally entertaining even when things aren't going bump in the night.An enormously entertaining read that promises you will either laugh or scream at least once on every page. If you read \"Darkhouse\" (and you really, really should), I hope you have as much fun watching Karina Halle flaunt classic horror-movie conventions as much as I did!"}, {"userName": "Navessa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18104163-navessa", "userReview": "Well, fuck. I have no idea how I feel about this so I'm just going to leave it at three stars. Do I like Perry? Not sure. I can\u2019t tell if I think she\u2019s a delightful misfit and a welcome change from the usual speshul snowflake, or if she\u2019s just a petty, judgmental bitch with an infuriating lack of self-esteem. I went back and forth with her throughout the whole frigging book. And Dex? Is he interesting and complex? Or a complete asshole? I couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of him. And what the fuck was up with that cheesy speech about Perry during the meeting with his boss? I thought the message was fantastic but the way it was done just seemed completely out of character. And don\u2019t get me started on his propensity for the word \u201cretarded\u201d and the fact that he seems to think that bulimia is something that stupid people \u201csubscribe\u201d to instead of a legitimate disease. I did like the creep factor, for the most part. There was one scene there in the middle though that probably should have creeped me out more than it did. The geography of it was sort of off though, and I ended up re-reading passages because I thought I\u2019d skipped pieces. La, la, la, I\u2019m running down the beach. Ooh, now I\u2019m climbing a cliff, it\u2019s dark. Wait, where the fuck did this forest come from? There was also some strange sentence construction, a few weird plot holes, and some editing fails.

I keep hearing that it only gets better from here on out, so I will definitely be picking up the next book soon. BONUS for those not in the know : Darkhouse is an ebook freebie at just about every book seller.There's something out there. Now you see it; now you don't.~ There be ghost hunting. Yar. No further explanation necessary.~ There be lots of great conversation. Good banter makes me happy. I also appreciated the author's phrasing in random places. I felt like I was listening to a real character's voice. Formality was thrown out the window, and I liked that.\n  \n    I know, I know. A motorbike.

It was like Lamb Chop's Play-Along on acid but without the endearing weirdness of acid.\n  \n~ There be abnormal characters. As in, all of them. I can relate. I ABSOLUTELY can relate.I'm going to quit with the 'there be' now, before you all think I'm completely uneducated. Dex might end up being another \"hell yes, I love him for being different\" type of character like how Paul from How to Kill a Rock Star was for me. Dex is handsome, yet not overblown \"romance novel\" type of handsome. He's not tall or super built, but he has something going on in the looks department that catches Perry's eye. He has a weird 'stache and an outdated eyebrow ring. He's got some \"crazy\" going on inside of him. He hangs with hot chicks, yet is drawn to the normal chick. He's just all kinds of kick-ass to me. I love his offbeat personality. Perry described him as reminding her of Robert Downey Jr. in his strung-out drug days. How's that for the anti-perfect alpha male type? But ladies, he can sing! So it's all good.Perry is not your typical young woman. She's brash, she's strange, and she's not rail-thin. She's ten years Dex's junior, but she somehow manages to be a good match for his brand of crazy.My final thoughts : I felt like the first half of the book was a bit of an over-tell, with a few moments which could have been pared back a little, but much of the setup evened out by the second half when the story finally started to find its groove. After a while, I forgot about any complaints that I had when I first started reading because I was enjoying my time spent with Perry and Dex so much. It's the banter and the chemistry, people! Love!I can't say that I was particularly creeped out (yet), but the tone of the story was dark enough that the ghost hunting concept started off with a bang. Here's hoping that I will catch more of the creepy vibe in further installments as we follow the team on more adventures. And if nothing else, I'll get more time with Dex and Perry together.\n  \n    \"The truth scares you.\"He leaned in closer across the table and this time grabbed my forearm.\"You scare me, Perry,\" he growled. \"You.\""}, {"userName": "Pavlina Read more sleep less blog\u2764\u2764  ", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6603203-pavlina-read-more-sleep-less-blog", "userReview": "I didn\u2019t know what to expect with this book,I have never read anything like that before but since it was highly rated by a lot of people, I thought I would give it a shot!I wasn\u2019t disappointed!This book was amazing!!!!!Perry Palomino's life hasn't turned out quite the way she had planned.

I'd initially been warned from many that this first installation is more of a decent warm-up to an incredible series, so I consequently lowered my expectations a bit. I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how immensely I enjoyed this book; it was precisely what I needed to shake up my realm of reading. Perry is not your typical heroine. She's insecure and imperfect, but strong and determined\u2014not to mention, she drives a motor bike and sees dead people. Her emotional struggles are endearingly relatable, and she manages to get through it all while remaining hilarious and entirely lovable. She suffers from chilling, suspicious nightmares that would shake anyone to their core. But when she meets the eccentric Dex Foray in an abandoned lighthouse, things start to gradually become clear...\n  \n    He had such a lovely smile when he was using it for good and not evil.\n  \nDex is one sexy, ghost hunting enigma, and not easily placed in any typical 'hero' category. He's brooding and complex; protective; strange, and a slight ass\u2014but he's a unique ass. An ass that breaks the mold and makes you want to peel the layers of intrigue and get to what makes him tick. Armed with video cameras and iphones, he and Perry team up to take on the paranormal...setting off an entertaining, humorous, and bone-chilling sequence of events. I loved that Dex was not instantly smitten with Perry, and if he was, he hid it well. He was cool, collected and remained a mystery for the majority of the story--which intrigued me to no end. His little spurts of anger were sexy and his quirky tactics were charming. \n  \n    \"I just want you to enjoy the pies in life, Perry.\"\n  \nAlthough an actual love story seems to be brewing, the romance went unexplored in this installation. Which was fine, because their cat-and-mouse antics were adorable and I loved their unique friendship. Perry of course had this undeniable, secret attraction to Dex--but who could blame her? The man is as odd and mystifying as he is sexy. If Johnny Depp morphed into a slightly unstable, fictional ghost hunter\u2014I'm certain it would be Dex Forray! For those reluctant to dabble in this genre, I can promise you that this book is most likely a cake walk compared to some. Yes, it has its creepy, heart-pounding, intense, edge of your seat moments\u2014but I believe the true levels of terror are offered in the books to follow...rendering this the perfect opportunity to get your toes wet!

It will be interesting to see how much her family plays in the future books. I would love more Ada when she's a few years older. I really got a kick out of her Uncle Al as well. Not sure how I feel about Dex's girlfriend...or how he feels about her. Seems like he's bipolar there too. Unfortunately, I've read things about her in the future and I really don't like that. So, you're probably still wondering if I think this is scary or not. Well, not really. I mean, it does keep you involved and there is that bit of freakiness and definitely of the unknown but it didn't keep me up at night. Not yet anyway. But the whole haunted lighthouse and \"I see dead people\" plot is pretty good. I do want to know more! There isn't a cliffhanger but obviously the story is ongoing especially with the seventh book just out and there's at least two more to go. I can't wait!Favorite quotes:\u2666 \u201cYou?

Get it, get it!!  http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/darkh...https://www.smashwords.com/books/view...I'm not normally much for horror books, but I've recently been trying to loosen my rabid grip on all things romance. Turns out, I truly tend to need it to stay interested. The great thing about that is that even male authors tend to throw a little romance into their plot somewhere. So when I started seeing this series pop up all over my feed, amidst my also-romance-addicted friends, for months on end, it for sure caught my attention. You know how each time a new hit series comes out, it's touted as \"different\"? Well, THIS is the definition of different within the circle of readers that I usually follow. Perry Palomino: She's in her early twenties, fresh out of college. She's not gorgeous, but she IS real. She has a little extra junk in the trunk, and her self image is not so hot considering that she's had weight issues for most of her life. And unlike many books, her low self esteem isn't used so that she can act like an idiot while men and boys drool on their chins and follow this goddess in hiding around. Perry's just normal...in the looks department, anyways. In the way of psyche, this chick has issues!!!! Perry has dreams...she has day-mares, nightmares, and visions...but sometimes that curtain of reality is very thin, and Perry can't tell what's dream and what's really happening.Dex Foray: Talk about an unconventional hero!!! This guy comes across as even weirder than Perry!!!! Dex is an internet show video cameraman. The way he's described isn't normally the way I would envision a man that I would become so fascinated with. His appeal doesn't come from his looks, but from his odd characterization, and the little glimpses that you get of the inner Dex. Dex and Perry meet in an old abandoned lighthouse in the middle of the night. Perry certainly wasn't looking for anything supernatural. But Dex is! Their first meeting is an awfully frightening experience for this reader. Secret slamming doors that lock themselves, ghostly footsteps, and sun bright lights...I literally had to turn on my lights to keep reading...my reader light was just causing unnecessary shadows. The fact that Perry's iPhone happened to record much of the experience is a plus when she posts her video online and gets loads of unexpected hits. And therein lies the excuse for Dex to contact her and push his internet video show idea...The Experiment in Terror.While romance is definitely not the point of the story, there is an underlying sexual tension between Dex and Perry...I'm assuming it will eventually lead somewhere.For me, this entire book was one big mystery. I can't quite figure Dex out. He's just so odd. He's moody, he treats Perry like an annoying kid sister at times, but looks at her like he's dying to know her soul. He's not the type of hero to go saving the damsel in distress, but then he turns around and protects her in other ways...redeeming ways that make the rest of it all okay. Perry is extremely likeable, but hard to empathize with. The girl needs to grow a pair and stand up for herself! Be bold in life and not just scary situations.I can honestly say that I haven't been this excited about a new-to-me series in months. At then end of Darkhouse, I've already loaded every available book in the series onto my Nook...I'm that sure that I'll love them! If you're bored with the current offerings, if you're continually being disappointed by the newest craze book and need something to sink into, give this a try. It may not be for everyone, but it was such a massive hit for me, and has my anticipatory nerves firing like crazy. I can't wait to devour more Dex and Perry!!!Buddy read with Brenda, MK, and the BR-ers...so excited to see what the fuss is about!!!!"}, {"userName": "Vishous", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7500821-vishous", "userReview": "I am afraid.... I am very afraid.... afraid to write this review... because I have a feeling GR community, that is a big fan of this series, will probably make me suffer by locking me in a room with lighthouse keeper... I had this feeling too when I was writing a review for KA's book RAID. So many people loved it, and worships the author, that I was terrified to write that it was really nothing special.I have heard that this series gets better with every following book and that is why I was literally pushing myself to finish this first book in the series so I could jump on others that are much better and see what the fuss is all about with Dex & Perry.TERRORso many updates and so many gifs gave me the impression that this books is spooky and scary....So I got myself wondering ...DECLAN DEX FORAYLiked him, I have a feeling I will like him more as the story goes but... as mysterious as he was and with knowledge that I will probably end up loving him and his mustache, I didn't feel that SWOON BOND with him for now...don't hate me :(PERRY PALOMINOAs a character I really liked her. She cracked me up sometimes but again... I already have a feeling I will like her more as the story goes... so I will leave my high expectations for other books.don't hate me :(OVERALLIn this experiment of terror I didn't feel that terror.

I would have never been aware of this series or author if it weren't for all of my GR buds talking about how awesome this series is, and how they have fallen in love with the mysterious, moody character; Dex Foray. Darkhouse is the first book in the Experiment of Terror series, and as with tons of my fellow readers, I have fallen in love with this series. This is not a romance, (although I am hoping that one day Dex and Perry might become involved!)instead this is more of a horror, suspense, mystery, and comedy all rolled into one awesome package! Karina Halle has written an amazing story that is equally entertaining, laugh out loud funny at times, and in some scenes I literally got goosebumps from how chilling they were! Her descriptive writing is amazing, and she is able to articulate so well about what she wants the reader to see, that I literally had a movie playing in my head. This story was beautifully written and her writing skills amaze me!The two main characters in this book are unique individuals who I am eager to watch grow and learn more about as the series progresses. I like how we have been given a glimpse into who they are; but not a full disclosure. Their still is much to be revealed, and I can't wait to find out more!Perry is a very likeable character, as I feel she has been written into your average, realistic woman. She has insecurities about her weight, and she often doesn't have much confidence in herself. Yet, when the chips are down, she is able to kick ass with her karate moves. I love that Perry isn't this unrealistic woman with huge perky breasts, and model tall height!!LOLAs for Dex...I don't even know where to begin with him! I adore him and his humor! I can't wait to find out exactly what makes this guy tick! He is described as \"Dark, Brooding, and Mysterious\"; he's handsome and when he looks at Perry she has said that \"his eyes read your very soul\".. The scene where Dex made me melt for him was when he stood up for Perry to his producer!:\"She may not be a self-obsessed stick-thin bimbo, but she more than right for this job....\"\"She's smart, she's funny and she's not afraid to take risks. Not to mention that she's beautiful, sexy, and charming. You know it, I know it, and soon everyone else will know it. The only person who doesn't know it is her because of archaic fuckheads like yourself telling her otherwise..\"AAAAHHH...that is my favorite \"Dex\" part in the whole book!!LOLI don't want to go into the storyline too much, as I don't want to give anything away. This is a must read book though, and I can't wait to dive in to the next book. I have been told that this series gets better as time goes on and I certainly believe it! So, onward to the next adventure of Dex and Perry, and I am sure there wiil lots to learn and more creepy scenes..Oh, and who knows...maybe that creepy clown lady will be seen again!

And let me just say, it felt fantastic to finally get to experience what people have been raving about. All I can say is the hype is definitely warranted. This is just the first book but already I can safely say, I am hooked. I already love Perry. Dex...he's definitely growing on me. \n  This book had the right amount of creep, mystery, chemistry and it had also had a lot of funny moments. I thought it would be too heavy for me but I felt that the author was able to balance the whole thing. It's not too dark that you get suffocated by it, neither it is too light, you end up not taking it seriously. But what really made the book for me was Perry. Her struggles as a 20-something trying to pursue her dreams, (kinda hard when you don't even have an idea what you want to do), was very relatable. She was like totally me 12 years ago. I'm so glad Ms. Halle didn't write her as this perfect girl with the perfect figure and the face that's to die for.

All you need to convince me, really, is to tell me it has ghosts--and these are not the sweet ghosts you can fall in love with either (which I will never be fond of), these are evil: truly and relentlessly evil.Having been reading a lot of Young Adult novels, it was a nice change to get a protagonist that's a bit older. At 22 years old, Perry is dealing with an unfulfilling job, a non existent sex life, and her bubbly teenage sister. Then she gets a pretty unexpected surprise when she goes to explore an old light house and something\u2026 more than normal, occurs. Talk about an exciting start! Not to mention this hot guy she happens to stumble upon--Dex. These characters are a lot of fun to go through this story with. They both have mysterious pasts that lends even more creepy to this story. Dex, especially, with his more than secretive personality. I was always on edge when he was around, yet somehow, I didn't feel threatened, just highly suspicious. He has this bizarre aura that screams something is not right with this fella. Nonetheless, the two of them have a lot of chemistry, making this book very compelling in a lot of ways. While the characters are endearing, it takes a little bit to get the story moving along. The pacing at the beginning wanders. Like I mentioned, it starts with a bang when something hugely creepy happens, but afterwards it slows down tremendously until the half way point. I wasn't bored per say, mostly wondering where the plot was headed. Once we do reach the half way point, however, it's a pretty fantastic and spine chilling ride until the end. There's more than enough menacing encounters and strange discoveries to make up for the slower half. If it was not the first in a series, though, I would have been disappointed by the lack of answers from both the characters' lives and the plot. We don't get very deep into the mysteries surrounding everything, but knowing there are a lot more books to follow, it simply makes me indefinitely curious for answers. Everything is so cryptic and perplexing, it's certainly feeding our thirsts for mysteries and the unexplained. From terrifying old ladies (I mean, she stares! Creepily! And that's just creepy!), to adrenaline filled paranormal occurrences, this is a book any ghost fanatic should absolutely check out.

When i started reading this one , i was'nt sure if this was a 5 star read at all . I'll tell you why , because it started out really slow and somewhat irritating . Well i'm not really sure about the irritating part , must have been the med's i took to get rid of this flu that i've been down with but anywhoo this book was totally not i expected it to be . Its scary , its funny , its adventurous , its got a little steam too building up on the Main Characters - Perry and Dex , in short its \n   downright amazing !!! \n Romance and horror are two my most fav genres in book reading , mix or combine them together and  WALLAH !!!  i'm sold ! Karina Halle has impeccable timing when it comes to humour and horror . One moment she's gonna make you 'laugh out loud ' with Perry's sarcasm , Dex's grinny naughtiness or their bitter sweet banter and the next she'd have you 'pee in your pants 'kind of scared and quivering . I'm too excited to see where all this goes and whats next for our amateur ghost hunters . There are still too many unanswered questions concerning Dex and also Perry's , so i'm definitely dying to know more . If horror is your thing then i would suggest you grab a copy of this book right now !! Its supah dupah amazing !!"}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2127955-holly", "userReview": "5 starsEvery once in a while I stumble across an author that just completely takes me by surprise in a wonderful, squee-inducing way. This time, it was Karina Halle. I had heard some amazing things about her Experiment in Terror series, and have been meaning to check it out for quite a while. And after only reading the first few pages of Darkhouse, I knew this was something special.22 yr old Perry Palomino has been haunted by bizarre dreams that have a habit of coming true. While on a weekend getaway with her family, she decides to explore an abandoned lighthouse on her uncle's property. A lighthouse that is rumored to be haunted.While there, Perry not only gets the bejesus scared out of her, but she stumbles across one Mr Dex Foray. Filmmaker and wannabe ghost hunter. The two form an unlikely alliance as Dex convinces Perry to help him make a 'demo' ghost hunting documentary for a website he works for. Perry...oh how I loved this spunky little spit-fire. And I could relate to her on so many levels which only added to my love of this book. She's snarky, and insecure. Just trying to find her way in life & she sees Dex and his plan of becoming ghost hunters as a way out of her dull life.And speaking of Mr Foray. He's mysterious and sexy...a smartass to Perry one minute, and fiercely loyal to her the next. He can be a little scary, and a lot vulnerable. He's a hipster with a porn 'stache, and probably more than a little crazy. He is all those things and more, and I love him to pieces.The creep factor in this book was impressive. I don't spook easily, but there were definitely times when this book made me feel unsettled. And don't get me started on Crazy Clown Lady...\n  Some of my favorite highlights:\n\n  \"Now wait a minute,\" I started, \"how do I know that this is legitimate? I mean, you could still be a bald-headed meth addict hobo I stumbled upon in the lighthouse.\"\"I'm not bald yet.\"\"If we head into that lighthouse and see a bunch of weird whatnots and such and such, it's not going to make any sense unless we know the how, the why and when.\"\"We should probably have a safety word too,\" he said.\"A safety word? Like in S&M?\"His smile flashed, animated and bright.\"The safety word is 'Jell-O'.\"God help me if I ever had to say 'Jell-O' for any reason.\"How come you aren't afraid?\"\"Because I find life scarier than death.\"\nWith just the right mix of chills, snark-tastic banter among two fantastic characters & a plot that kept me entertained from page one, Darkhouse is a great start to a series I'm anxious to dive back into.\n  DARKHOUSE IS STILL FREE ON AMAZON. NO REASON TO DELAY...CLICK HERE AND GRAB THIS BOOK NOW!!\nRead more of my reviews at my blog: http://ravingbookaddict.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Lucia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8837962-lucia", "userReview": "Darkhouse was my first book by Karina Halle and I was pleasantly surprised with her intriguing style of writing. She made me laugh, made me feel scared and created very different, original and interesting characters in this book. I like when authors are able to use the right amount of sarcasm in theirs stories, and Karina Halle definitely knows how to do that. I never watch horror movies but I love reading horror stories. It has been quite a long time since I read some horror so I am very grateful that EIT series were recommended to me by my goodreads friends (big thanks to Fathima!). Perry Palomino is \"delightfully impulsive\" 22-years old woman who grew on me right from the very beginning of this book. She works as a receptionist and even though she is not happy with her job, she knows it is better than having any. The thing I like the most about Perry is the fact that she is funny and remarkable kind of person, always choosing the more crazy and more interesting alternative when given a choice. I really like Perry and she made a perfect narrator for this book. Dex was also very interesting character. I could not figure him out, there was something mystical about him but I liked it. A lot. Most of the time, he was driving Perry (and me) crazy but I had to like him nonetheless. Both, Perry and Dex, are not ideal or perfect people, they have their flaws but it makes them very likeable characters. Moreover, it was very easy for me to feel connected to them on many levels. I realize that this book is not for everyone. But if you like realistic characters set in paranormal setting with some horror aspects, go for it. And I am sure you will love it. \n  MORE REVIEWS ON MY BLOG"}, {"userName": "Rosa, really", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12242401-rosa-really", "userReview": "[therapy and psychiatric drugs (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Alex ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11057966-alex", "userReview": "Lil' buddy read with Her Highness La Lionne. :DRefreshing scary story.

I think it's a great foundation to the start of a *gasp, 9+ book series. I will take my friends advice and continue the adventures of Perry and Dex. Overall it was good and I liked it.

Though she\u2019s been dealing with a quarter-life crisis and post-college syndrome like any other twenty-something, she\u2019s still not what you would call \u201cordinary.\u201d For one thing, there\u2019s her past which she likes to pretend never happened, and then there\u2019s the fact that she sees ghosts. Luckily for her, that all comes in handy when she stumbles across Dex Foray, an eccentric producer for an upcoming webcast on ghost hunters. Even though the show\u2019s budget is non-existent and Dex himself is a maddening enigma, Perry is instantly drawn into a world that both threatens her life and seduces her with a sense of importance. Her uncle\u2019s haunted lighthouse provides the perfect catalyst and backdrop for a horrific mystery that unravels the threads of Perry\u2019s fragile sanity and causes her to fall for a man, who, like the most dangerous of ghosts, may not be all that he seems.", "title": "Darkhouse\n      \n          (Experiment in Terror #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11356211-darkhouse", "average": 3.78, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1360092374l/11356211.jpg", "reviews": 1630, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4785031.Karina_Halle", "name": "Karina Halle"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Horror", "Paranormal", "Fantasy", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11356211-darkhouse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11729060-darkhouse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11796796-darkhouse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16029994-sins-needles", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21899546-love-in-english", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23844390-the-pact", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17230559-shooting-scars", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17230557-on-every-street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9409759-powers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38213061-leviathan-wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
