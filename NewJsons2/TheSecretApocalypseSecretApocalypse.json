It was decently written (though could use an editing pass) and flows pretty well with a lot of action. It starts out with the lone survivor of the apocalypse of the entire country of Australia (a 16-ish year old American girl) reaching America and being hounded by reporters to tell her story.Most of the rest of the book is the story of the beginning of the outbreak (manmade virus, purposely tested on \"collateral\" humans, of course it gets out into the general population), living through it, and her escape. The characters are fairly well drawn, and the story is told through the eyes of the main character.I think my quibble is mostly that it just wasn't believable. I know, like a zombie-ish apocalypse is totally believable, right? This group of 4 teenagers, one a soldier, and the sister of one of the teens (a cop) manages to maintain and stay safe through all kinds of messes, when others are dropping like flies left and right. Stuff happens to them, yes, but they seem to have better luck than all of the rest of the entire population of Australia...Though the infected are converging upon others and spreading their disease like mad, they are more of a background story than the soldiers, who are hell bent on containing the virus and gunning down everyone, infected or not. This good luck group of kids, though, are smarter than the average bear, of course, and have greater fortune than anyone else. There is good explanation of the advent of the virus, the escape, and containment efforts, and the main character tells her story well.Worth a read, if you can stand a group of teenagers who survive through hell and back with little adult assistance in the midst of an out of control virus."}, {"userName": "Randy Harmelink", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2029520-randy-harmelink", "userReview": "Despite the number of reviews both here and on Amazon that mention numerous typographical and grammatical errors, I decided to give this book a chance. It's obviously been cleaned up since the early release, because I only noticed a handful of errors.I enjoyed the book, but there wasn't really anything there that elevated the book beyond an average level. I don't think it really deserves either a 3 rating or a 4 rating, but about a 3.5.Usually, I reserve 4+ ratings for books I can't put down. But I found this one easy to put down and come back to later. I liked the writing, I liked the main characters, but it just didn't \"excite\" me the way better books can. Too many of the escapes were more luck than anything else. No one really even had a plan. No one was really a leader. It's a miracle they survived as long as they did."}, {"userName": "John Podlaski", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3772926-john-podlaski", "userReview": "\"The Secret Apocalypse\" is a fast and entertaining read. This story is told through the eyes of a sixteen year old high-school girl; she is the sole survivor of the \"Oz Virus\" - a military weapons test that goes awry. The virus has mutated and and the vaccine is no longer effective. Ground zero can't be quarantined - the virus is spreading too fast via blood and saliva and troops are quickly overwhelmed by the attacking hoards of zombies. The military goes to great length to contain this epidemic and reverts to blowing up bridges and other escape routes to create a controlled quarantine area, unfortunately, thousands of survivors are killed as collateral damage in the process.There is no stopping the virus and the military is desperate, unleashing jets, helicopters, napalm and nukes to kill zombies and survivors alike. Government killer teams are dispatched throughout the country in search of survivors that may have come in contact with the virus but haven't turned yet - they are rescued then taken to secret centers, unknowing that they will soon be dissected and become \"specimens\" in the experiments to develop a vaccine.Rebecca and her friends are in the middle of all this and must evade both zombies and soldiers in their quest for survival and to escape the country. There are many twists and turns along the way, plenty of places to bite your fingernails or hold your breath. Rebecca appears to be the \"sole\" survivor from the apocalypse in Australia, the virus claiming the remaining 22 million citizens. We'll have to read the next book in the series to find out what happened to her friends...they all split apart before her rescue. Are they all dead?I liked the story a lot and would recommend it to others, but must also agree with other reviewers regarding the lack of editing within the story...at times, it is distracting. If the book were \"fixed\", I would most likely give it four or five stars. This book also includes an excerpt of the next book which sheds some light upon the earlier question - I will most likely purchase it to see how this story progresses.John Podlaski, authorCherries - A Vietnam War Novel"}, {"userName": "Kathleen Miller", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3047844-kathleen-miller", "userReview": "I bought this (via Kindle) on a whim, without digging too much past seeing that it had a good star rating and it was cheap. I did not realize it was a YA book. While the grown-ups of America seem enamored of YA fiction these days, I am not one of them. Too often a book written for teens reads like it's been written by a teen. Just because someone is under 18 they don't deserve well written fiction?

That just isn't right.I wanted to read this because the title was intriguing and, well, it was free. But I'm not likely to pay out for the rest of the series. (Sorry James Harden.)So the protagonist, Rebecca, is being interviewed. She panics and ends up in the bathroom, recapping her entire experience on a notepad. This moment of remembrance is, essentially, the book. So while the book is written in the present tense during the interview period, most of the book is in the past tense. I must say that this creates a pretty cool effect, as we think we already know what the outcome will be. But then, BAM! Something unexpected happens right at the end, something Rebecca is shocked to hear.Australia has been hit with the Oz Virus. It kills the host but keeps them functioning, basically turning them into the living dead. But Australia is under a nationwide quarantine - meaning the rest of the planet has no clue what's happening.Rebecca and her friends are trying to escape both the infected and the military, while trying to find food and shelter at the same time. They find themselves in an empty casino, where they come across Dr West - one of the doctor's responsible for creating the Oz Virus.One friend is bitten, they're all close to being test subjects, and they have no idea when the rest of the world will start sending help. Things are pretty tough.But, as we know from the start, Rebecca does make it out alive. But what happens to her friends?The plot is pretty good, and I like the mixing of past and present tense. But the grammar. Oh, the grammar. Misplaced commas, simple sentence structure, spelling mistakes... It's pretty stressful. And a lot of it is Rebecca saying \"Kenji told us to do a thing, so we did it.\" It is a good book, but it needs a lot of work. A lot.So, 2.5 stars. I liked it, but it could be way better."}, {"userName": "Anthony Fitzgerald", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1265960-anthony-fitzgerald", "userReview": "I had a really hard time finishing this book. While the story was intriguing, the rampant grammatical errors and misspellings, as well as the author's writing style, kept me from being truly enthralled. The majority of the book ended up being rather boring. A lot of this revolved around the way the author overdoes unnecessary dialogue. For example, if Rebecca (main character who essentially narrates this novel) says something like \"they all started to argue about leaving\", this is followed by nearly every character saying \"We should leave\", \"It's not a good idea, we should stay\", \"I agree we should leave\", \"guys it's not safe here, we should leave\". These aren't quotes from the book, but you get the idea. After several pages of this when it could have been taken care of in one paragraph, you feel like jumping into the story and telling them to shut up and decide!!There were a few exciting scenes involving bridges, tunnels, and a casino. While these were fun to read, they could have been fleshed out a little more in places. A lot of the story though felt a bit far fetched, and this is a sci-fi novel, so that's saying something!! Certain situations had me saying \"really? Come on.\" The end of the novel is pretty exciting and leads into a sequel which was recently released. Unfortunately, the lack of focus on the Oz virus, and no real character development to make up for it, leaves me skeptical about reading part 2. My friend read this as well and downloaded the sample. If she reads and likes it, maybe I'll pick it up. Until then though, I'm off to something else!"}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7756793-megan", "userReview": "This was a fun, fast-paced, quick and easy read. It started a little slow but around 25% in it really picked up and was action packed for the rest. Let's start with the good things about this book. The thing I liked most was that the back story of the virus was plausible. I could completely see why Australia would be used for a covert, secluded research and testing lab. I liked the different settings chosen to tell the story in, they all seemed like exactly the sort of places people in those situations would choose. Now the not so good. There wasn't anything that I truly disliked about this book, but there were a lot of things that I thought could have been better. My main issue was character development and connecting to the characters. I just kept waiting for the characters to start dying and I wasn't particularly nervous about it. Sometimes the thought of a character leaving a story causes me to be sad, like a friend moving away, but I just didn't feel like I would be disappointed to see any of them to go. My other issue (and it's a very small one) was that sometimes the action turns occurred just a little too quickly, like an awkward segue way instead of a smooth transition, like the author was so excited to get to the next action point they had written that they couldn't spend the needed time to develop the story in between."}, {"userName": "Shea", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/502324-shea", "userReview": "Well, this is very clearly a debut sort of novel (available on Kindle for $2.99). It'd be an understatement to say that there are grammatical/spelling errors throughout the book; someone definitely should not have skimped on paying the proofreader.That said, I like the concept of this novel. It reminds me of the B-list movie \"A Day Without a Mexican\" where the entire state of California is cut off from the rest of the world and made to deal with its situation alone. In [b]The Secret Apocalypse[/b] the country of Australia is cut off from the entire world while the military and Government attempt to contain and/or eradicate the infection.However, it takes reading almost 70% or more of this novel before some action happens. There's a brief scene on the bridge in the middle of the novel, but you don't really see any good, non-stop zombie / \"we need to get out of here now\" until the end. When it does happen, it is good.There will be more later on down the line in this series, and I can only hope the author focuses more on the Oz virus, its effects, and the actual story line rather than the inner thoughts of the main character."}, {"userName": "Alasdair Martin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33759500-alasdair-martin", "userReview": "Pretty dire.
