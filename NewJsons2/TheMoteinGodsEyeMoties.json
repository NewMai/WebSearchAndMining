Robert A. Heinlein himself is quoted as saying something to the effect that this was the best science fiction novel he had ever read. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d go that far, but this was very good. David Allen Coe claimed to have sang the perfect country and western song, and in that same regard, Niven and Pournellle may have collaborated to create the perfect science fiction novel, it contains all of the important elements: future, space travel, time travel, aliens, space ships, laser blasters, planetary colonies, etc. etc. Whoever created the 1980s film Gremlins may have read The Mote in God\u2019s Eye and been inspired by the miniature Moties, or watchmakers. Called a masterpiece by many, and it may well be, but it is not without its flaws. There are inconsistencies, the language of the New Scotts and New Ruskies is superficial and distracting, and it is too long, some good editing may have shaved a hundred pages and strengthened the narrative.Still it is very good. The creation of the Motie alien race was masterful, full of brilliant and thoughtful attention to detail. Though the characterization is not an especially strong point, many characters are painfully one dimensional and static, the authors created a Nietzschean juggernaut in Admiral Kutusov, and he steals the show. ** 2017 reread - as good now as ever, a little dated, sexist yes, oddly aristocratic, but fun.

The Mote in God's Eyeis generally considered to be their partnership\u2019s best book (have a look at Larry Niven\u2019s Goodreads page).I believe the blurb by Robert A. Heinlein that appears on many editions of the book\u2019s cover* has been around since its first publication in 1974; and it has undoubtedly helped to shift thousands of copies (mine included). I guess it is a little like if you were a guitarist and Jimmi Hendrix tells people you can shred like a demented mofo. Who can resist that kind of recommendation? Is it just hyperbole, though? Is The Mote in God's Eye worthy of the accolade?Yes, it is. This is a first contact story rendered very believable and engrossing by the authors\u2019 skills and attention to details. The \u201cMoties\u201d are one of the most well-conceived alien races I have ever come across. An earlier example of very alien aliens (aliens so alien they alienate me). Although they are very alien, very strange, they are imbued with enough human character traits to be understandable. Of course, completely inscrutable aliens are fun but the more understandable aliens can be more emotionally invested in. I love the concept of \"specialized subspecies\" of the Moties, there are several variations in their species evolved for specialized tasks, such as technicians, warriors, mediators etc.A Motie \"Warrior\", art by yoggurt.As the novel was written in the 70s its age inevitably shows in places. There are terms like \u201chyperspace\u201d and \u201cpocket computer\u201d that we do not see in modern sci-fi. Today\u2019s authors tend to invent new words for \u201chyperspace\u201d and \u201cpocket computer\u201d sounds very quaint as they are now commonplace in the form of smartphones and tablets. These few terms notwithstanding I would argue that The Mote in God's Eye stands the test of time very well. The alien\u2019s design and their extreme specialization are just as wonderfully \u201cSF-nal\u201d on this reread as it was when I first read about it decades ago.I have no idea who write what in the Niven / Pournelle partnership but they clearly work very well together, there is a unified voice in their highly readable prose style. The characters are better than just flat plot devices, though the book is clearly more about the plot than the characters. Both authors are excel at writing hard science fiction and the science details make the story that much more vivid and believable without ever bogging the book down with excessive infodumping. The \u201cdramatis personae\u201d at the beginning of the book kindly provided by the authors to help the readers keep track of a fairly large cast of characters is an interesting feature. However, the book is written so well that I never found it necessary to refer to it at any time.The central and very human theme of this book seems to be how difficult it is for different races to coexist peacefully when there is a conflict of interest and when negotiations are hampered by deceptions. The issue is not entirely resolved in this book but leaves a lot of room for the readers to speculate and draw their own conclusions. There is a less well-received sequel called The Gripping Hand which I am not sure I will read as I am more than satisfied with this book\u2019s ending.One of the all-time greats IMO.__________________________________* Heinlein\u2019s blurb reads \u201cpossibly the finest science fiction novel I have ever read\u201d."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3268864-james", "userReview": "[the choice to give the aliens a translator caste and make their voices mirror copies of the humans they talk to (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "[9/10] Because of the Alderson Drive we need never consider the space between the stars. Because we can shunt between stellar systems in zero time, our ships and ships' drives need cover only interplanetary distances. Any self-respecting space opera must start by postulating first a method for overcoming the vast emptiness of the space between stars. You can call it 'unobtainium' or  'equipotential thermonuclear flux' , but you need to overhaul known physics principles in order to move instantly from point A to point B, several light-years away.The second thing the writers need to come up with is conflict: something to put meat on the bare bones of the plot. Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle gives as right from the prologue a couple of millenia of our space faring future, complete with technological breakthroughs, explosive colonisation followed by economic collapse, imperialism and rebellion, space fleets modelled after the British colonialism Navy, complete with its highly exclusivist social structure.The detailed setup, and the lively introduction of the Hero, in the incarnation of a young and daring scion of a noble family who distinguishes himself as temporary ship captain in putting down an armed insurrection on a colony world, is merely the background for the most important event humanity has faced so far: first contact with an alien civilization. They could be the greatest potential danger we have ever faced, or the greatest potential opportunity we've ever found. Out of a tiny speck of light hardly visible in the corona of a red supergiant (the 'mote' and the 'God's eye'), an exploration ship using a hydrogen scoop light-sail is coming into the human known space at crawling Newtonian speeds.

The novel may look like a doorstopper but it reads like a blockbuster, at least for those readers who are more interested in speculative ideas and hard science than in well-fleshed out characters or stylistic flourishes. There's enough action and humor to satisfy also the more impatient popcorn style of reader, but for me Niven comes closer to the golden age of SF here, in the Arthur C Clarke and Isaac Asimov mould.I would say \"The More in God's Eye\" is a classic of a genre and should not be missed by SF afficionados."}, {"userName": "Tripp", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/867938-tripp", "userReview": "Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle wrote a number of science fiction novels which I fondly remember. The Legacy of Heorot tells the story of colonization and the perils of misunderstanding xenobiology. Footfall is an exciting update on the War of the Worlds. Lucifer's Hammer concerns the collapse of society in the face of a comet impact on Earth. My major issue with Lucifer's Hammer, bloat, is a much bigger issue in highly regarded Mote in God's Eye.The bloat issue is gigantic here. The first 150 pages are boring exposition filled where we meet the stock characters (engineer with Scots accent, plucky female aristo along for the ride, young dashing military commander) and learn about the painfully uninteresting world of the future. Once we meet the aliens, known as Moties, it takes many more pages before we learn anything about the society. There are many portentous allusions to things the Moties don't want the humans to learn. It takes so long to get to the revelations, that I really didn't care once I read about them.All this padding would be fine if Niven and Pournelle had provided a rich world to explore. No such luck. While the initial concept is interesting ( US and USSR unite, colonize space, have a civil war, new empire tries to pick up the pieces) it quickly devolves into cutting and pasting from 19th century Britain. The navy is straight from Horatio Hornblower, with officers named sailing master and teenage midshipman running crew sections.The Church (which is Catholic, a bit odd given the leading space powers were largely Protestant and Orthodox) is clearly more powerful, without serving any narrative purpose. Has the Church followed its social justice wing or become a rival power center to create challenges for the elite? Has the theology created cultural restraints on the development of technology or society? No and No. All the more galling the Church apparently hasn't changed much at all in a millennium.There is a decent story about alien contact amongst all its problems, but it is such a short part of the book, it is probably not worth working your way through to find it. As the humans encounter the Moties, they learn that the society could threaten human society. The debate concerns the means by which they must deal with it. The viewpoints expressed nicely describe the classical realist view of politics. Alien first contact follows similar rules and problems as seen in foreign relations. What makes a country a threat? How do you manage threats? What is the purpose of interacting with other societies at all? The book has some interesting, if one-sided, things to say about this, but you have to wade through hundreds of pages of crap to get there. If you are looking for a classic to discover, beware this one."}, {"userName": "Annago", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1087136-annago", "userReview": "The Mote in God's Eye is probably the finest contemplation of a human-alien first contact that I have ever read. The story deals out a sizable cast of characters without seeming overwhelming. Mote explores every issue from multiple perspectives, leaving no room for good vs. evil simplifications despite that fact that some characters are not likable. The core theme of the book - that a superior alien intelligence is limited by its inability to tolerate ideas based in hope and imagination - evolves slowly enough to maintain interest and tension throughout the \"slower\" (i.e. non-action-packed) sections of the book. However, Mote does not suffer from its lack of astounding plot twists; rather, its intricate storyline builds a believable, sympathetic and ultimately engrossing fictional universe."}, {"userName": "Penny", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10165256-penny", "userReview": "This is a fantastic first contact novel! I thoroughly enjoyed it. The Moties were fascinating and much like their fellow human cast, I found my opinion of each of them changing as the story progressed. There were many whom I loved at first and came to dislike, and vice versa. All in all a wonderful set of characters to journey through the difficulties of first contact with.There are a lot of considerations when two intelligent species meet in space for the first time. How much do you keep back? How much information can you learn about the other without giving away too much of your own nature? How do you appear both friendly and strong? How do you hide the worst of your species? It makes things very difficult for both parties I think. Both go in with assumptions learned from their own experiences which can't accommodate for the fact that the others are alien. It makes for interesting communications.To those who think this book contains sexist aspects, I disagree. It's military. There is one main female human character. She says some things about contraceptive pills that implied to me that you don't need them unless you're sleeping with lots of men and proper ladies don't do that. That was the kind of world they lived in. It was the same kind of world that had aristocracy and titles. She also had the choice to not just get married but to rather study and have a career, which she did. I didn't get the hit of sexism, and when forced to confront the question I actually see a fair amount in the opposite direction. And I was pleased to have a female character in an action / military scenario who didn't have to kick ass just to be there. I'd been meaning to read this for ages and I'm glad I did.

Grand Master Robert A. Heinlein called it \"possibly the finest science fiction novel I have ever read.\" It easily makes my Top 10 Sci/Fi Book List.The story is set in the year 3017 A.D. The Second Interstellar Empire of man is in the process of forcefully reuniting many colonies long lost since the collapse of the 1st Empire, when an alien slower-than-light space craft enters the New Caledonia system coming from the direction of the Coalsack Nebula. From the nearby colonies, this black nebula looks like a hooded man with a large red giant star positioned as a single eye with a small yellow star embedded. The image is so powerful that a cultic religion claimed that the Coalsack visage was in reality the image of God. Our story is about mankind\u2019s first contact with an intelligent alien species, and a subsequent expedition to the barely visible yellow star system or \u201cmote\u201d in the middle of \u201cGod\u2019s Eye.\u201dThis book is probably the finest contemplation of a human-alien first contact that I have ever read. And itdoes one of the best jobs of creating a truly alien life form, a richly textured alien culture and an array of carefully drawn characters placed in complex situations with no easy solutions. The difficult task of the fantasy writer is always whether to make aliens that are really alien and thus difficult to understand, or to make them more human-like, so the reader can easily relate to them. In this case, the Moties are not only biologically and culturally peculiar, they also have well thought out alien motivations that drive them in ways that mark them as distinctly un-human.The many human characters are generally stereotypical and predictable as individuals, though together they form a diverse group, each character with a different perspective which the novel explores thoroughly. This careful diversity serves to advance the action and explore the many complexities of the plot. The result is a gripping mystery as well as an adventure story, which left me with a strong sense of empathy for the individuals of both civilizations and how they were affected by these most unusual circumstances. The Mote in God\u2019s Eye presents the classic problem of first contact: Are the aliens a terrible danger or a unique opportunity? Should they be welcomed into the Empire, or should they be obliterated? The military is charged with the responsibility of determining whether the Moties are a threat to humanity, and with preventing their discovery of human technologies which might increase such a threat. On the other hand, the expedition\u2019s scientists become champions of open communication, scientific and commercial exchange. In most tales of first contact with an alien species, they come to us, and they aren\u2019t here to make friends. Niven and Pournelle encourage us to reverse the tables, and ask: \u201cWhat if we traveled to an alien home-world, and our intentions were not entirely benevolent?\u201d This tale makes clear that an alien species' concerns about contacting us for the first time would probably be the same as our concerns about contacting them. One of the things that make this such a great book is that the parallels just keep coming. After a while we have a hard time knowing who has the mote and who has the beam in his eye. Upon arriving in the Mote system the human expedition discovers a technologically advanced race of beings genetically engineered for high efficiency and speciated into various casts such as engineers, mediators, and rulers each with it\u2019s own extraordinary innate genius. The culture resulting from these biological distinctives is an utterly alien type of industrial feudalism. This vast dissimilarity is accentuated by glimpsing first contact from the Motie point of view. They are as absolutely amazed and bewildered as are the humans. This provides another wonderful parallel hearkening back to the theme of seeing others differently than we see ourselves.As the humans surmised from the slower than light vessel encountered in New Caledonia, despite their amazing technological advancement, the Moties have not fully mastered the art of hyperspace jumps between stars, as humans have, and consequently have been bottled up in their own system for countless years. It is determined to prevent the Moties from learning that technology at all costs, at least until they prove not to be a threat.The humans and Moties play the game of diplomacy, each trying to learn what they need to know while trying to keep the other side from learning dangerous secrets. There is also tension between the scientific and military sides of the expedition, and their conflicting goals. The scientists become convinced the Moties are benign, while the military sinks into paranoia. The truth is believably complex, and lies somewhere in between. This book is far from allegory, though it was written in 1972, and raises several cold war issues, such as the rational reasons both races have to distrust the other and energetically act for self-preservation regardless of the cost to others. Niven and Pournelle explore every issue from multiple perspectives, leaving no room for \u201cgood vs. evil\u201d simplifications. And in the end we learn that despite their great secrets, the Moties are neither evil, nor are they completely virtuous: they are in this way at least - just like mankind.The intricacies of inter-species politics is one of the reasons this work is so intriguing. It forces us to ask whether our histories are so very different, and to examine the potential for humanity to fall into a Motie-like dystopia. We are forced to ask whether a species is justified in causing the extinction of another sentient species in order to preserve itself. We also are brought to reflect upon whether the Motie\u2019s unique history has compelled them toward cynicism, and disdain for hopeful ideas and attitudes, and if we are so very different in our views of the future. This book is loaded with intriguing \u201cmote/beam\u201d questions!In Sum, I would describe The Mote in God\u2019s Eye as a classic space opera, with plenty of action, lots of hard science, and an intricate storyline set in a believable, sympathetic and ultimately engrossing fictional universe. It is extremely thought provoking, and stands up well to re-reading. Decades after my first reading I still enjoy this book immensely."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8283913-tom", "userReview": "[ The Big Secret that the aliens are trying to keep from the humans is that they have a ridiculously high reproductive rate, and as a result go through periodic population explosions and crashes and horrible wars as a result of this.

Again, this is never mentioned. Basically, the science fiction plot twist and amazing alien revelation is sprung on us but at the same time never critically applied to our own situation, we are just supposed to take it at face value and apply it to the aliens without thinking too deeply about its implications for us or how it reflects on our society.

Maybe it has something to do with being influenced by my Dad to read the Isaac Asimov novels, or more likely it has something to do with my life long passion for science-fiction. However, the books written in my father's generation seem to have a lot more character, and a lot more insight, than much of the rubbish that seems to be churned out today (though maybe that has a lot to do with the consumerist nature of our society and that books are really only written on the basis of whether it will sell or not).\tThe Mote in God's Eye is a story, set a thousand years from now when humanity has colonised space, about the first contact with aliens (at is sentient extra-terrestrial life). The one thing that seemed to strike me as I was reading this book is that one could use the same concept when dealing with historical incidences of first contact, such as with the Native Americans or the Australian Aboriginals (or even the Chinese, though we have been in contact with the Chinese since Roman times, allegedly).\tBefore I go too deep into this novel, I will give you my thoughts on the story itself before I spoil the actual story for you (but don't worry, I will warn you beforehand). I can't say that it was the best book that I have read, and it did seem to drag on a bit, however at first I though that it was simply going to be a dissertation on a speculative alien culture that was definitely not human. However, just when it began to slow down, the action suddenly picked up again, and some rather nasty facts were revealed about these aliens. Mind you, we are revealed the truth about these aliens halfway through the book, and the rest of the novel you are left hoping that humanity realises the truth before they get themselves into no end of trouble. At this point though, I better warn you:\tThe novel begins with a probe entering human space from a star called the Mote. The reason that it receives this name is because it can be seen in conjunction with a larger star called Murchenson's Eye (discovered by some guy named, surprise, surprise, Murchenson) which has a nebula that looks like a hood as its backdrop. On board this probe is a dead alien, so the humans decide to travel to this star to make contact with the first alien civilisation that they have discovered.\tThe scenario does not follow the same story as many of the first contact scenarios on our world have played out (namely a technologically superior culture encounters a culture that is still living a hunter gatherer lifestyle, and the technologically superior culture then proceeds to conquer and oppress the hunter-gatherer culture) but rather we have two cultures that are both technologically advanced which results in a story of political manoeuvring where both cultures attempt to develop a relationship without revealing their dark secrets.\tOne of the things that I found interesting about the aliens, called the 'Moties', is their origin. As I was reading this book I was really interested in finding out what they looked like, so of course I entered 'Motie' into Google Images, and came up with a number of pictures. This is one of them:\tThe reason that I found them interesting was because one of the themes of the book was evolution. One of the characters suggested (before first contact was made) that the reason that humans have not evolved beyond their current form is because when they evolved to this form they turned the evolutionary process around to change nature to make themselves comfortable. This is my attitude towards evolution in that creatures evolve, or more precisely adapt, to their surroundings, and when one can adapt their surroundings to suit themselves, evolution is no longer necessarily.\tHowever, as it comes out, the Moties had continued to evolve, not so much because they needed to adapt to their surroundings, but because their surroundings became so toxic that they began to mutate. The the reason that they are asymmetrical is because they became involved in a nuclear war which began to mutate them. However, as is also suggested, there are elements of genetic engineering as the race is divided into castes that perform certain tasks for the whole.\tThe other thing about the Moties is that they reproduce quite rapidly. This I found to not be as speculative as some may consider as it is something that confronts us today. If you travel to some parts of the world you will discover huge overcrowding. Not only that, but the population explosion means that resources get used up much quicker. Back when this book was written, much of the majority world was living in poverty, and it was only us in the west that were living like kings. However with the rise of India and China we are suddenly finding that the resources (and space) are becoming ever more scarce. This is a reality in our world, namely that as populations increase, the demand for resources, and living space, also increases. Where there is not enough living space countries suddenly go to war to get more of it. We even see this here in Australia as the price of freestanding houses go through the roof. Then there is also the question of asylum seekers. The reason that Australians do not want asylum seekers to come to our shores is because we like our space, and our free standing houses. The more people that come to our shores, the less space we have for our back gardens."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david", "userReview": "Larry and Paul... doesn't that sound like a sitcom couple? I've read a lot of Niven and Pournelle's collaborations over the years, and at the height of my Very White Space Opera phase (i.e., when I was a teenager with no taste and liked anything with spaceships and aliens in it) Niven was one of my favorite authors.The Mote in God's Eye was their first collaboration, and never having read it before, I was expecting something like Footfall. It kind of is, but of course it was written over twenty years earlier. This shows mostly in the fact that like most 70s science fiction, computers are still big clunky shipboard installations, and interstellar communications are formatted like telegrams and decrypted on tape machines. Other than that, though, the SF holds up pretty well; Niven and Pournelle have always written relatively hard sci-fi (yes, I use \"SF\" and \"sci-fi\" interchangeably - get over it!), and their close attention to astrophysical, engineering, and biological detail makes this a book that, aforementioned computer/communications issues notwithstanding, reads like a fairly contemporary work.Sci-fi-wise, that is. Character-wise... oh boy, that's another matter.So, let's start with the setting. It's the Empire of Man, some millennia after humans left Earth and began colonizing the stars. There have been collapses and previous empires before now, and the current Empire actually has technology inferior to what bygone space empires had. But in all these centuries, no sentient alien race has ever been discovered. Then an Imperial warship encounters a probe launched from a star system that is a \"mote\" in a stellar nebula; the probe contains a dead alien pilot, and results in a ship being sent to investigate the system it came from. The crew discovers a race which the humans call \"Moties,\" who appear to be friendly and peaceful and highly civilized. They are actually superior to humans, mentally and technologically, their only disadvantage being that they haven't yet figured out how to build working faster-than-light starships, so they are still trapped in their home star system.The rest of the book is mostly told from the human point of view, but sometimes switches to the Motie one. We learn that the Moties, well, aren't so peaceful (surprise!) and they have a few secrets they are trying to keep secret from the humans.As a First Contact novel, this is a very good one. The aliens are alien, and don't fall into any easy roles. They're not malevolent, per se, and individual Moties can be friendly (and refreshingly, they are individuals \u2014 Moties, like humans, don't all think alike or subscribe to the same philosophies and racial strategies), but they are definitely a threat. When the humans finally figure out the truth, they face a real moral dilemma.Where The Mote in God's Eye fails, though, is characterization of the non-aliens. The humans are all straight, and I mean straight, out of 70s Central Casting. You have heroic square-jawed aristocratic naval officer Roderick Blaine, ruthless planet-killing Admiral Kutuzov, the sleazy bad guy Horace Bury who of course is a Muslim Arab, and Lady Sally Fowler, a noblewoman, anthropologist, designated love interest, and the only woman in the book, who at one point informs the Moties that humans have birth control technology but \"decent women don't use it.\" We're supposed to admire the generally lawful and benevolent Empire of Man, even though it's about as socially progressive as Victorian England, and like Victorian England is in the middle of colonizing other human worlds by force. The stereotypes would have been less grating if the characters weren't also so flat; they did little but play their roles.So, this is good science fiction, but hardly great literature. If you want interesting aliens and an examination of civilizational ethics, with a decent amount of spaceship action thrown in, enjoy, but there isn't a lot of depth, nor characters you're really going to care about."}, {"userName": "Jake", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/972904-jake", "userReview": "Like so many books I\u2019ve read, The Mote in G-d\u2019s Eye was recommended to me by father, many years ago.

Mankind has seeded the stars, thanks to the faster-than-light Alderson Drive, and has also reverted to living under an Imperial Monarchy, thanks to the clich\u00e9s of science fiction (to be fair, this book probably helped establish those clich\u00e9s, so I can\u2019t take it to task too much). In the aftermath of an uprising on some outer rim worlds, Commander Roderick Blaine discovers an alien probe approaching the system that his ship is in. While the pilot of the ship is deceased, it still proves the basic point: humanity is not alone in the universe.Blaine and his ship are quickly drafted as part of the mission that sets out to find the alien home world and make first contact between the human empire and the Moties (nicknamed such because their home planet is located in a star system referred to as the Mote in G-d\u2019s Eye). As one would expect, the first contact is fraught with a variety of questions and problems, which quickly result in everything from complicated political intrigue to outright violence.First contact stories are always tricky, for one simple reason. Creating a believably alien race is tough enough (witness Star Trek for a number of failures, among others), but anticipating the assorted problems that might occur from that first contact is even harder. Niven and Pournelle do a bang-up job, however. The Moties seem very plausible, yet totally alien; indeed, in a clever twist, the Moties bodies are not symmetrical (they have a single large arm on one side, and two smaller arms on the other), which helps to remind the reader just how inhuman these creatures are.Unlike some science fiction novels, however, this book contains more than an interesting idea. The story itself is well-executed and interesting to follow, as various factions on both sides try to make sense out of their new situation, and figure out how to exploit it to their own advantage. The pace is just slow enough to maintain a feeling of mystery, without being so slow as to be completely boring. And, in a wonderful twist, most of the mysteries are answered by the end of the book. There\u2019s certainly further that the story COULD go, but there\u2019s no reason that it needs to go any further. It\u2019s fine the way it is.Robert Heinlein apparently said that this was \u201cpossibly the finest science fiction novel [he had] ever read.\u201d There might be points I\u2019d argue with Heinlein on, but this isn\u2019t one of them. This is a damn fine book."}, {"userName": "Megan Baxter", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter", "userReview": "Solid science fiction about first contact, set in a universe where humanity reached the stars, fractured, and has slowly knit itself back together under imperial/aristocratic power.

Heinlein called \u201cpossibly the finest science fiction novel I have ever read.\u201d The story takes place in 3017 AD in the future of Jerry Pournelle\u2019s CODOMINION universe (though it\u2019s not necessary to have read any of those books to enjoy The Mote in God\u2019s Eye). Humans have developed the Alderson Drive which allows them to immediately jump to certain points in space. Thus they\u2019ve been able to colonize many planets which are ruled by a single government similar to the British monarchy.Up to this point humans have assumed they\u2019re the only intelligent species in the universe, but an alien spaceship has just been detected near the Mote system. The spaceship MacArthur, captained by Lord Roderick Blaine, is dispatched to intercept the alien. Besides its regular crew, MacArthur has a couple of civilian passengers temporarily on board: Horace Bury, a trader and political prisoner, and Sally Fowler, a cultural anthropologist (how fortuitous) and senator\u2019s niece.It turns out that the alien in the probe ship is dead, but the humans figure out where the home planet must be, so Roderick Blaine, Sally Fowler, Horace Bury, a priest, the crew of MacArthur and a team of scientists are sent on a diplomatic mission to the planet they call Mote Prime. The ship Lenin is sent for back up. It\u2019s captained by Admiral Kutuzov, a ruthless but effective man whose job is to not let the Moties learn anything that could help them build an Alderson Drive and escape the bounds of their own solar system.Upon arrival at Mote Prime the diplomats find that the Moties are friendly and want to be allies. An alliance and trade agreement with the Moties would be beneficial to the human empire because, except for the lack of an Alderson Drive, the Moties are far more technologically advanced. But that means they\u2019re also a threat. The diplomatic mission must discover all they can about the Motie society so it can make a recommendation to the empire about how to deal with this species they\u2019re sharing the universe with. This, of course, is not as easy as it seems. Do the Moties really have pure intentions toward the humans, or are they deceiving them for some reason?The Mote in God\u2019s Eye, published in 1974, is a nice change of pace from most of the human vs. alien science fiction that had been previously published. Niven and Pournelle create a truly alien society and explore its evolution, history, sociology, and motivations. The story is compelling because Niven and Pournelle capitalize on the mystery, leaving the reader as much in the dark about the Moties\u2019 true intentions as the human characters are. The truth is surprising (though, I thought, not completely believable).Niven and Pournelle write unique stories but they\u2019re not superior stylists; I read their books for the plot and ideas \u2014 not to admire their use of structure or language. This particular story is interesting, has a few great characters (Blaine, Kutuzov, the priest, and the Brownie aliens), and has an occasional nice touch of humor, but it sometimes suffers from shallow characterization, excessive dialogue, and an old-fashioned feel. The action is exciting, but limited. There is a lot of the normal \u201chard SF\u201d explanation of drives, fields, stars, ships, etc, but there are also a lot of meetings in which the humans (or aliens) are trying to figure out what the aliens (or humans) know, assume, intend, and plan. Some of this was amusing (for example when the aliens are trying to figure out some aspects of human behavior) but many of the discussions just go on too long. Also, for a story set in 3017, ideas about birth control, sex, and women\u2019s roles in society feel rather quaint.Read the rest at FanLit: http://www.fantasyliterature.com/revi..."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/667234-james", "userReview": "A brilliant and gripping book. One of the best jobs of creating a truly alien life form, culture and civilization, rather than the usual \"aliens\" who act just like human beings who happen to look different - and then going on to let the human reader see events through those alien eyes, from their perspective. The human characters are also well developed and the plot serves as a gripping mystery as well as an adventure story, and left me with a strong sense of empathy for the individuals of both civilizations being affected by forces larger than any one character."}, {"userName": "Harv Griffin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12275178-harv-griffin", "userReview": "This is my favorite Science Fiction novel. Number One. It starts with a bang. The level of writing is excellent. When I re-read it, I read almost everything. If God's Eye doesn't hook you in the first few pages, you may be unhookable. It has it all. Space battles. A central love story. A surprising depth to the characters. The prose is unusually nuanced for hard Science Fiction, and a joy to read.Larry and Jerry raised the bar for the \"First Contact\" SciFi novel, and as far as I can tell, no other novel has come close. (I am eager to read any suggestions in the \"First Contact\" category which may approach this puppy.) Just as a great romance novel succeeds because of the misunderstandings between the protagonists; here God's Eye really shines due to the misunderstandings between the humans and the Moties.It's actually hard to find anything wrong with God's Eye. Yes, with a copyright of 1974, the slant on women is a bit dated--one woman on a ship with hundreds of men may confuse today's female readers as much as the alien Moties were confused by this. One female SciFi fan posted on an Amazon thread that the first three quarters of God's Eye is the finest Science Fiction she has ever read. I see her point. The ending takes on a different emotional character, when our political leaders have to actually decide what to do about the alien Moties. But the ending works for me, and I don't skip it on re-reads.Confess most of Niven's and Pournelle's other novels don't really work for me. I did enjoy The Legacy of Heorot. I am a difficult reader to please. Many Science Fiction novels fail for me, I think, because the author had to pop the book out quickly to make a living at all in the genre. Somewhere in the dusty shelves of my library I have an interview (I couldn't find it, and so am relying on untrustworthy memory) that claims that the first submission of The Mote in God's Eye was rejected by their editor, who returned the manuscript with copious notes on how the novel should be structured, and many other additional suggestions. I believe God's Eye is a masterpiece because of this forced rewrite & reorganization, which gave them more time to take the story to the next level.And so the next time my editor marks up my sacred text, I'm going to think long and hard before telling her what she can do with her red pencil. @hg47 ."}, {"userName": "Porter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/173638-porter", "userReview": "This was a fun, old-school first contact story.

Not being a herd animal, I have a tendency to avoid all the \u201cpopular stuff\u201d. Which is to bad because sometimes I miss something important.The Mote In God\u2019s Eye is a fine example of a \u201cfirst contact\u201d novel. It has everything: human galactic civilization, space battles, heroic spacemen, counter-plots, and very alien aliens. There are plenty of characters and much of the action is told through multiple points of view. The authors do their best to try and describe the aliens reasons and methods. No small achievement. This is one of the best science fiction books ever written.The plot in basic: In the far future, humanity has expanded to the stars. After a turmoil resulting from the fall of the first human empire, a second has been established and is determined to unite the civilized worlds in harmony and peace, even if it has to be done by brute force. Humanity is ruled by a benevolent, if despotic, emperor who sends his fleets off to bring the lost sheep back into the fold. During one small skirmish near the Horse-head Nebula, an interstellar spacecraft is intercepted from the first non-human civilization. Although the pilot of the spacecraft is unintentionally killed, much excitement is generated within the empire and an expedition is mounted to seek out and discover the aliens. Eventually, the humans make contact with the new civilization, only to find the aliens have reasons of their own for venturing into the galaxy. Reasons which many not be harmonious with the overall aims of humanity.Niven and Pournelle accomplished a lot with this novel. When they wrote the book, the idea of galactic empires seemed retro, but they researched the possibility enough to make it believable. A few years late a certain movie would hit the screens and the idea seemed plausible once again. Connection? Maybe.The aliens are known as \u201cThe Moties\u201d from the section of the galaxy where they originated. Somewhat mammalian they are broken down into a whole series of specialized castes for their dedicated jobs. Some give orders, some mediate, some do the heavy lifting. I would like to have seen the book spend more time on their planet, but the human reactions were the focus.The weakest part of the book is characterization. The authors throw a myriad of humans at the reader, but few are memorable. And some of them are down-right stereotypical: the New Scotsman who speaks in a brogue, a space navy admiral of Russian descent who drops his articles when talking, etc. The book focuses on the ideas and concept of The First Contact.Still one of the best science fiction novels I have read.
