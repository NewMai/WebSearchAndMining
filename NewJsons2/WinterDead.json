Man in snowy woods fighting off zombie wolves with a machete\u2026 This guy might be boned. Zombie wolves are just creepy. It is both really cool that the zombie wolves faces are hanging half off, and really disturbing. This should be an interesting book.This book has multiple stories in it. The stories start where a previous book has left off. Each has multiple layers to them that help keep interest enthralled with the characters\u2019 lives. My favorite character in this book is Juan. He\u2019s awesome because even though he has a criminal past, he fights like hell to redeem himself and protect others. He\u2019s an unwilling leader to a group on an island that survive because he\u2019s willing to do whatever it takes to protect them.Andrew McFerrin is the Narrator. His voices help keep the listener spell bound. I love the Egyptian accents that he uses. He is fast becoming one of my favorite narrators. The Author is TW Brown. Dead: Winter is part of the Dead series. It is eleven hours and thirty-four minutes long.I love the multiple levels of the characters in this book. Each story helps show the struggles people would face in this new world AZ (After Zombies.). Warning \u2013 There is violence, death, blood, and horror within this book. There is also life, love, and laughter.That\u2019s what makes it awesome.This book left me with the craving need to know what happens next in this series. It left me wondering about the supplies I\u2019d need in an apocalyptic event. It left me wanting to make sure those I care for will be protected in any event. It also makes me wonder how anyone could prepare for events such as these within this book.Audiobook provided for review by the author."}, {"userName": "Nicole Storey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6157333-nicole-storey", "userReview": "Finally! After months of waiting, pacing, begging, and wondering, TW Brown\u2019s new book in the DEAD series is here! I was lucky to get an advanced copy from Mr. Brown before publication. Needless to say, I read it in less than a day. I must say I have never had a book pull so many emotions from me. It\u2019s one of those stories that, when you finish it, makes you feel like you\u2019ve gone fifteen rounds with a champion boxer. I mean that in a good way, though!DEAD: Winter \u2013 in fact, the whole DEAD series \u2013 is a book that makes you think. You find yourself asking questions, putting yourself in the minds of the characters, wondering if you\u2019d make the same choices they do. It\u2019s Zombie-Lit where the zombies are not the only problem the characters are dealing with. Heck, they aren\u2019t even the biggest problem! After reading the first three books, I was honestly scared to read the fourth one. I have grown so close to the characters \u2013 they almost seem like family to me now. I kid you not; I was terrified at the beginning of every page. By the end, I had chewed the inside of my cheek to shreds and had cursed Brown several times. LOL! For those of you who are fans of the series: Make sure you have plenty of tissues and a pillow to punch. My cheek is just now healing up.Some series start to sink after the third book, know what I mean? The author tends to run out of ideas, so they recycle problems their characters have already dealt with. I have to say this book was as mind-blowing as the first. There is action, drama, and death at every turn. Oh, and yes, there are zombies! I also love that Brown introduced some new characters and delved a little further into the pasts of some of the others. This book has it all and more!So now, I sit and wait for December for the fifth book. I pray Brown will be gentle and not kill off too many members of my DEAD family. I wonder how he can possibly top this thrilling book with one that will be even better. I have no doubt he will, though. He\u2019s accomplished that four times now. Lastly, let me say that if you love brown\u2019s DEAD series, please, PLEASE check out his other books. I have read them all \u2013 from the Zomblog series to Dakota. There\u2019s a reason he is one of my favorite authors!"}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "The Forward to this episode is fabulous and portrays exactly how I feel as a reader!Again TW Brown manages to bring tears to my eyes and a smirk to my lips with just the Authors note; this bodes well for the rest of the book. I can now truly understand the meaning of Fan(atic!).The first few chapters splat you straight back into the action, a quick catch up on my favourite groups with slight nods to remind you of how the last entry left them.Raw emotion seems to be the theme, TW Brown takes you from pure fear, elation at shear survival and now back to the fear and loss all over again.New characters are introduced as you are lurched further into hell.The underlying horror of the zombies is clear but the real story is the endless depth of reality that is given to the characters, you catch yourself wondering what you would do with them? who would you fall for? who would you argue with?Kleenex is mentioned at the beginning and yes, you need it! this gave me more tears than a chick flick!I have become so attached to some characters that when they are injured, hurt, killed (!) or lost I miss them in real life! How could you put Jaime through all that pain; you cruel, cruel man.The new Eygptian story line is fascinating! The poor lab rats.... have they found the cure? but so isolated, so alone.Must every group have such a bloody/heart rending loss?Have to say though if Buster gets it.... . I am waging war on your butt, beware TW Brown!Another brilliant installment of this riveting series.The end leaves you wanting and promising you more....."}, {"userName": "Selinalynn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4330920-selinalynn", "userReview": "This is the 4th book in the DEAD series. Zombies have taken a backseat to a more vicious killer, winter. As the weather starts changing groups are starting to realize that they may be ill prepared. We continue on with Steve's group and their fantastic fortress. Juan takes charge of the island with Mackenzie at his side. Kevin has found a good place to hole up, but he now has to face some demons from his past in a new survivor. Chad has found a place with a sizable population. Though as we have seen with other books looks are deceiving.We do lose a few but there are also new characters who join these varied groups, but as always caution first. At which hands are worse, Dying from a bite of a zombie or the harsh winds and snows of nature."}, {"userName": "Kels", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5407419-kels", "userReview": "I really wanted to give this book 5 stars but I really don't like some of the vignettes. All I really care about are Steve and his group, Juan and Mackenzie and of course the Geeks. So had it not been for a shit ton of skipping past some stories I'd have given it 5 stars. I will say this. T.W. Brown has a way of getting you emotionally invested in his characters. I'm still not feeling the \"tight like a tigah\" but I'm enjoying the character development. There's a lot of bad exposes in these series and it really makes me think about how there are truly bad and crazy people in this world...but there are good ones as well."}, {"userName": "Jessica Bakaitis", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7615445-jessica-bakaitis", "userReview": "This series is amazing.

A good set of characters with some interesting (all though predictable) storylines. I really do like the author style of writing. One storyline is written in first person, a second storyline is told in third person and then you have a few short story like side plots....very interesting.However, for how good the concept is for this series, there are some problems with the delivery. I will mention the lack of editing in this books, misspelled words, missing words and so forth. However, these things are kind of expected these days in ebooks in the sub $9.99 category. These are first time authors that are not making the needed money for professional editing.The misspelling and minor editing problems are one thing, but there are a few somewhat major plot problems. These are details that result in an author maybe taking on a storyline structor that is a little too grand. Here I even found a character getting killed even though he was already killed the previous book. There are situations popping up that were never a problem before but suddenly they are. Just over all details that just done fit properly.I think most of these flaws are because the author is still fairly new, he has the raw talented needed to be a great story teller, he just needs the experience to fine tune his craft.I am really enjoying this series as a whole and I look forward to future books. I'm just mentioning these little problems because I don't want people to overlook a great story because of a few rough edges."}, {"userName": "Sonja", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8927384-sonja", "userReview": "I will miss the \"crews\" till they come back! Really, do I have to wait till December to see where this all goes? :).I do per se not read many zombie books, because usually they are pretty much the same: zombies bad, people good, people survive. I tried the first book of the dead series when it was available for free on amazon, and got sucked right in. I really liked Stephen King's Calla series, and while this world just inhabited by zombies is not as magical as Calla is, I still feel for the groups that stumble through the different scenarios that the post-zombie world brings. So, Mr. Brown, please bring it on, so I can continue to follow the roads the groups take."}, {"userName": "Rhonda", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7402836-rhonda", "userReview": "Read Kindle version May 2013 and just finished with the audio version. Rating remains 5 stars. I absolutely love this series. I get completely lost in the story of each character, their strengths and weaknesses. The way they handle the apocalyptic threats are unique to each and are true to their backgrounds. We lost another really bad guy, but there are always more lurking nearby to take their place. One of my favorite characters died and I cried. Mr Brown really paints a very realistic picture of a zombie apocalypse and of its survivors."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Murphy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40051265-jennifer-murphy", "userReview": "Every book in this series has been great, but I think \"Dead: Winter\" was the best yet. Each group had their own issues while struggling to make it through the winter, but the one thing they all had to deal with was bitter cold temperatures and insane amounts of snow. I can't even imagine what I would do in their situations.
