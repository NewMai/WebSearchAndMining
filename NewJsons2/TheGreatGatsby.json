Jay Gatsby, who dreamed a dream with the passion and courage few possess - and the tragedy was that it was a wrong dream colliding with reality that was even more wrong - and deadly. Just like the Great Houdini - the association the title of this book so easily invokes - you specialized in illusions and escape. Except even the power of most courageous dreamers can be quite helpless to allow us escape the world, our past, and ourselves, giving rise to one of the most famous closing lines of a novel.\n  'Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that\u2019s no matter \u2014 to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning \u2014\u2014 So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.'\nDear Gatsby, not everything I liked back when I was fourteen has withstood the test of time\u00b9 - but you clearly did, and as I get older, closer to your and Nick Carraway's age, your story gathers more dimensions and more tragedy, fleshing out so much more from what I thought of as a tragic love story when I was a child - turning into a great American tragedy.\u00b9 I hang my head in shame at my ability to still belt out an enthusiastic (albeit poorly rendered) version of '...Baby One More Time' when it comes on the radio (provided, of course, that my car windows are safely up).I blame it on my residual teenage hormones.Jay Gatsby, you barged head-on to achieve and conquer your American dream, not stopping until your dreams became your reality, until you reinvented yourself with the dizzying strength of your belief. Your tragedy was that you equated your dream with money, and money with happiness and love. And honestly, given the messed up world we live in, you were not that far from getting everything you thought you wanted, including the kind of love that hinges on the green dollar signs. And you *almost* saw it, you poor bastard, but in the end you chose to let your delusion continue, you poor soul.Poor Gatsby! Yours is the story of a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, running like a hamster on the wheel amassing wealth for the sake of love, for the sake of winning the heart of a Southern belle, the one whose \n  'voice is full of money'\n - in a book written by a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, desperately running on the hamster wheel of 'high life' to win the heart of his own Southern belle. Poor Gatsby, and poor F. Scott Fitzgerald - the guy who so brilliantly described it all, but who continued to live the life his character failed to see for what it was.The Great Gatsby is a story about the lavish excesses meant to serve every little whim of the rich and wannabe-rich in the splendid but unsatisfying in their shallow emptiness glitzy and gaudy post-war years, and the resulting suffocation under the uselessness and unexpected oppressiveness of elusive American dream in the time when money was plenty and the alluring seemingly dream life was just around the corner, just within reach.But first and foremost, it is a story of disillusionment with dreams that prove to be shallow and unworthy of the dreamer - while at the same time firmly hanging on to the idea of the dream, the ability to dream big, and the stubborn tenacity of the dreamer, \n  'an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again'\n.This is why Gatsby is still so relevant in the world we live in - almost a hundred years after Fitzgerald wrote it in the Roaring Twenties - the present-day world that still worships money and views it as a substitute for the American dream, the world that hinges on materialism, the world that no longer frowns on the gaudiness and glitz of the nouveau riche. In this world Jay Gatsby, poor old sport, with his huge tasteless mansion and lavish tasteless parties and in-your-face tasteless car and tasteless pink suit would be, perhaps, quietly sniggered at - but would have fit in without the need for aristocratic breeding - who cares if he has the money and the ability to throw parties worthy of reality show fame??? Because in the present world just the fact of having heaps of money makes you worthy - and therefore the people whose 'voices are full of money', who are 'gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor', people who genuinely believe that money makes them worthy and invincible are all too common. Tom and Daisy Buchanan would be proud of them. And wannabe Gatsbys pour their capacity to dream into chasing the shallow dream of dollar signs, nothing more.\n  'They were careless people, Tom and Daisy \u2014 they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.'\nThis book somehow hit the right note back when I read it when I was fourteen, and hit even truer note now, deeply resonating with me a decade short of a hundred years since it was written. If you read it for school years ago, I ask you to pick it up and give its pages another look - and it may amaze you. Five green-light stars in the fog at the end of a dock."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/713041-alex", "userReview": "The Great Gatsby is your neighbor you're best friends with until you find out he's a drug dealer. It charms you with some of the most elegant English prose ever published, making it difficult to discuss the novel without the urge to stammer awestruck about its beauty. It would be evidence enough to argue that F. Scott Fitzgerald was superhuman, if it wasn't for the fact that we know he also wrote This Side of Paradise.But despite its magic, the rhetoric is just that, and it is a cruel facade. Behind the stunning glitter lies a story with all the discontent and intensity of the early Metallica albums. At its heart, The Great Gatsby throws the very nature of our desires into a harsh, shocking light. There may never be a character who so epitomizes tragically misplaced devotion as Jay Gatsby, and Daisy, his devotee, plays her part with perfect, innocent malevolence. Gatsby's competition, Tom Buchanan, stands aside watching, taunting and provoking with piercing vocal jabs and the constant boast of his enviable physique. The three jostle for position in an epic love triangle that lays waste to countless innocent victims, as well as both Eggs of Long Island. Every jab, hook, and uppercut is relayed by the instantly likable narrator Nick Carraway, seemingly the only voice of reason amongst all the chaos. But when those boats are finally borne back ceaselessly by the current, no one is left afloat. It is an ethical massacre, and Fitzgerald spares no lives; there is perhaps not a single character of any significance worthy even of a Sportsmanship Award from the Boys and Girls Club.In a word, The Great Gatsby is about deception; Fitzgerald tints our glasses rosy with gorgeous prose and a narrator you want so much to trust, but leaves the lenses just translucent enough for us to see that Gatsby is getting the same treatment. And if Gatsby represents the truth of the American Dream, it means trouble for us all. Consider it the most pleasant insult you'll ever receive."}, {"userName": "Pollopicu", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2345961-pollopicu", "userReview": "This is my least-favorite classic of all time. Probably even my least favorite book, ever. I didn't have the faintest iota of interest in neither era nor lifestyle of the people in this novela. So why did I read it to begin with? well, because I wanted to give it a chance. I've been surprised by many books, many a times. Thought this could open a new literary door for me.Most of the novel was incomprehensibly lame. I was never fully introduced to the root of the affair that existed between Gatsby and Daisy. So they were in love...yeah..I've been in love too, who cares?Several times I didn't even understand where characters were when they were speaking to each other. I also didn't understand the whole affair with Tom and Mrs. Wilson.. and something about her husband locking her up over the garage...? huh? then she gets run over by a car, then he sneaks in through the trees and shoots Gatsby? wha..? still..why am I suppose to care about all this? Shallow and meaningless characters. Again, who cares? I read this book twice. 2 times. I just didn't get it. I can't believe this book is revered with the rest of the great classics. Truly unbelievable. Fitzgerald certainly kissed the right asses with this one. What garbage. Daisy quote:\u201cThey\u2019re such beautiful shirts,\u201d she sobbed.\u2026 \u201cIt makes me sad because I\u2019ve never seen such\u2014such beautiful shirts before.\u201d...sob..sob.. boo-hoo-hoo. oh Please someone shut her the fuck up."}, {"userName": "svnh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/157319-svnh", "userReview": "After six years of these heated and polarized debates, I'm deleting the reviews that sparked them.

You were ahead of your time. If you would have pulled your scam after the invention of reality TV, you would have been a huge star on a show like The Bachelor and a dozen shameless Daisy-types would have thrown themselves at you. Mass media and modern fame would have embraced the way you tried to push your way into a social circle you didn\u2019t belong to in an effort to fulfill a fool\u2019s dream as your entire existence became a lie and you desperately sought to rewrite history to an ending you wanted. You had a talent for it, Jay, but a modern PR expert would have made you bigger than Kate Gosselin. Your knack for self-promotion and over the top displays of wealth to try and buy respectability would have fit right in these days. I can just about see you on a red carpet with Paris Hilton. And the ending would have been different. No aftermath for rich folks these days. Lawyers and pay-off money would have quietly settled the matter. No harm, no foul. But then you\u2019d have realized how worthless Daisy really was at some point. I\u2019m sure you couldn\u2019t have dealt with that. So maybe it is better that your story happened in the Jazz Age where you could keep your illusions intact to the bitter end.The greatest American novel? I don\u2019t know if there is such an animal. But I think you'd have to include this one in the conversation."}, {"userName": "emma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma", "userReview": "DAISY BUCHANAN IS A GIFT TO READERS EVERYWHERE AND THE HERO OF THE GREAT GATSBY, FOR SURE, NO QUESTIONS, FIGHT ME IN THE COMMENTS IF YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE BOLD: A Thinkpiece by Mehttps://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...I\u2019ve known that Daisy effin\u2019 rocks since I first read this book. (Fun fact: my first read of this took place in the back of the family minivan when I was 13, on a roadtrip to, like, Disney World or something. While thoughts of princesses and mouse-shaped ice cream bars danced in my siblings\u2019 heads, I was reading about moral corruption in the Jazz Age.) (All because I saw online that if a college interviewer asks what your favorite book is, you should say The Great Gatsby. And for some goddamn reason, I was like, Yeah, it\u2019s definitely urgent that I, an eighth grade student, be prepared to have a college interview at any moment.) (I only ever had to do one college interview anyway, because only one was required and of COURSE I didn\u2019t opt into the non-mandatory ones because CANYOUIMAGINE. Guess what? The interviewer did ask me what my favorite book was. Guess what I didn\u2019t say? The Great f*ckin\u2019 Gatsby! I panicked and, I think, said All the Light We Cannot See, because it was the first non-embarrassing book that came to mind. My life is just one mistake after another.)Anyway. I loved Daisy then. I loved her two years later, when my English class read it and it was VERY clear that I was \u201c\u201c\u201csupposed\u201d\u201d\u201d to not like her, and, like, fawn over Gatsby\u2019s childish ass instead. Which, no. Picture this: fifteen-year-old me, who has Just Decided she\u2019s going to be cool now (a process which involved wearing 15 layers of mascara and no other makeup - neither an exaggeration nor a good look) in a room of twenty fifteen-year-olds, including cool ones, all VEHEMENTLY AGREEING ON SOMETHING.But I still stood up for Daisy. Because I have PRIORITIES.My senior year of high school, my morals and soul and ability to empathize were challenged by six students and a teacher in AP Lit. But I won the award for being the best English student in my graduating class, so honestly I think that\u2019s an indication that I also won that argument. And now here I am today, prepared to make the same argument to you all.And win.Obviously.But let\u2019s get into this. Here is why Daisy is not only innocent to the VILLAINOUS charges that have been placed upon her, but also the best character in this book and an absolute angel/joy/gift from the heavens. (Does that mean F. Scott Fitzgerald is God?)Also, this has literally all of the spoilers. And is long. But THOROUGH AND WORTH IT. Maybe.One: What was she SUPPOSED to do?So put yaself in Daisy\u2019s shoes, yeah? Let\u2019s take it allllll the way back. You\u2019re a teenage girl who is the hottest sh*t in all of Louisville. (This is a big deal, apparently.) You have SIX DATES A DAY! The phone never stops ringing!!! You have nothing but options!!Kidding, kidding. You only have one option, really, and that\u2019s marrying a rich guy. Don\u2019t we love historical gender expectations? I know I do!So then one day, this guy who\u2019s fiiiiine as hell shows up. And you guys start hanging out all the time, and he\u2019s so charming and hot and you guys get along like a house on fire. You have a really great kiss. The guy\u2019s a captain in the army, and he implies he\u2019s supes well off financially. It\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s the best case scenario for you.(This guy\u2019s Jay Gatsby, by the way. In case I haven\u2019t made that clear.)Then the guy has to go off to war. It sucks, sucks, sucks. You two write letters back and forth, but all the while your family is pressuring you. Society is pressuring you. Your friends are making backhanded comments about how you\u2019re still unmarried.The war ends. Sweet relief! Jay\u2019s coming home!Except no. He\u2019s at Oxford, for some reason? And he tells you he can\u2019t come home? And your letters get sadder and sadder, because you\u2019re out of time. The war ended, and you have nothing to tell your parents.So those six dates a day start back up.And then this guy pops up in town. He\u2019s reallyyyy rich. And buff. And a real society man. And he\u2019s not from Louisville - he\u2019s a way out. You can see the world with him. Best of all, he\u2019s obsessed with you.(This guy is Tom Buchanan.)So what do you do? You can\u2019t do anything. You have to marry him.And when you get a letter from Jay \u201cToo Little Too Late\u201d Gatsby, you scream and cry and try to stop the wedding, but there\u2019s nothing you can do. Ya hafta marry Tom \u201cSeems Okay\u201d Buchanan.Two: Now That\u2019s What I Call \u201cWhoops\u201dThe OTHER fun thing you get to do, in this life as Daisy Buchanan, is have children whether you want them or not.For awhile you don\u2019t mind Tom. In fact, you really love him for a bit. He does nice stuff like carry you so your shoes don\u2019t touch the ground, and the honeymoon\u2019s great, etc etc. So even though you don\u2019t have one mother-effin\u2019 ounce of an option in whether you want kids or not, when ya get pregnant, you think maybe it won\u2019t be that bad.And then Tom turns out to suuuuuck. You have to leave these places you love, where everyone is full-on obsessed with you, and you have friends and family and as close to a life as you can get, you have to leave because Tom is f*cking everything with girl parts and a ditzy 1920s accent.BUT NOW YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER. AND YOU LOVE HER SO MUCH. AND YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WILL BE FOR HER, BECAUSE SHE\u2019S GOING TO HAVE THE SAME LIFE AS YOU. And all you can hope is that she\u2019ll be a beautiful fool, like Tom\u2019s girls, so she\u2019ll be silly enough to be satisfied with life\u2019s inability to give her much of anything.And Daisy might be beautiful, but she\u2019s sure as sh*t no fool.Three: Ho-ly shit wait...does life not suck? Is there such a thing as a second chance?So you\u2019ve got this new life in New York, and you\u2019ve got a BFF from Louisville (Jordan Baker), and yes, Tom is cheating on you, but if he maybe just didn\u2019t answer the goddamn phone during dinner for once you could just forget about it for literally one freaking second.And then GUESS WHAT? Your old pal Nick Carraway is back! A friend, how amazing! HURRAY! And kinda strange, Nick wants you to get a weird one-on-one tea party on with him, but it\u2019s like, whatever, Tom\u2019s cheating anyway and you\u2019re not interested in Nick like that but he\u2019s a fun guy and you can just reject him.But waitholdupWHOA what a wild coincidence! The guy who was lowkey the love of your life, Jay Gatsby, is also here! How, well, coincidental! You can play catch up and see his bougie-ass house and whatnot. And cry over the fact that he\u2019s such a horrific asshole that he would leave you totally in the dust without contacting you for years and then all of a sudden appears and is like \u201cI am very rich as promised I live right across the water from you I can see your house let\u2019s get together here are all my fancy shirts I will throw them at you. So glad Nick is here for some reason let's keep on not letting him leave.\u201dPlus life with Tom, as mentioned, is not extremely great.So it\u2019s like, yeah, perfect, okay. Let's get some Gatsby on.Four: No. No, there is not a chance of life not sucking. Life is terrible and so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into a gUY WHO IS JUST AS BAD.GUESS WHAT WASN\u2019T A COINCIDENCE? ANY OF THAT. All along, even the people you trusted most - Nick, Jordan, Gatsby - have been manipulating you. There have been secret plans and lies and tricks and all of these things just to get you to f*ck a guy.And if you think about it, Gatsby is not nice or romantic or kind or fair to lil ol Daisy. At all. His expectations are insane. He got to leave her and build a life for himself and live as he wanted and travel and make up this story and be wealthy and throw parties, while she lived with a cheating husband. And after all that, if she wants admission into the life that being with him might give her, she has to say no, she wasn\u2019t ever happy, there wasn\u2019t a moment she loved Tom.Ridiculous.And when she plaintively says, \u201cI love you now. Isn\u2019t that enough? I can\u2019t help the past,\u201d she\u2019s just begging Gatsby to accept her. How absolutely tragic. Tom cheats on her, Gatsby expects so much - she\u2019s never been fully, truly, without-exception loved.Five: Gatsby literally sucks oh my godDAISY IS JUST A SYMBOL OF GATSBY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONQUER THE SOCIOECONOMIC CASTE SYSTEM OF THE 1920S. Like, if he can \u201cget\u201d Daisy (literally an object), that\u2019s not even enough. He has to have HAD DAISY FOREVER. Because then he\u2019s beaten Tom, the symbol of old money. He\u2019s so gross, literally. Here are 2 quotes on Gatsby\u2019s \u201c\u201c\u201cfeelings\u201d\u201d\u201d for Daisy which illustrate how much he sucks.\u201cIt excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy. It increased her value in his eyes.\u201dHer VALUE. Like she is an OBJECT. Because OTHER MEN were not enough, so he is THE BEST MAN. Daisy must\u2019ve fallen short of \u201cthe colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can think up in his ghostly heart.\u201dSo he made her into this manic-pixie-dream IDEA of a person, and we\u2019re supposed to be mad at her for not living up to it? Nah. Nope. Not going to happen. Gatsby sucks.Six: It\u2019s called the responsible choice, you raging dingbatsSo AFTER she\u2019s already been pressured by Gatsby to act as though entire swaths of her life didn\u2019t happen, she finds out Gatsby has been lying to her all along - keeping the truth from her in order to protect this psychotic fairytale concoction of a totally goddamn made up story. Like! A! Total! Freak! What the f*ck would you do? If you were going to leave your sh*tty gross husband for what seems like a better life, but really has always been a lie - and a totally full on creepy one at that. And what if you had a daughter, who it\u2019s made OVERWHELMINGLY CLEAR you love and worry about and she loves you too, so much. You\u2019d just leave her in the care of that sh*tty creepy cheating disgusting husband, who couldn\u2019t care less and would not be at all above using her as a chess piece??? You\u2019d leave her when everything you thought you knew was completely made up???? When it\u2019s just been your dearest loved ones manipulating you all along???No, the f*ck you wouldn\u2019t. Daisy\u2019s choices were protecting her daughter, and sexy times with a con man. There\u2019s no goddamn choice.She\u2019s great and smart and responsible. It couldn\u2019t have been easy for her to stay with Tom, who SUCKS. She says to his face that he\u2019s \u201crepulsive.\u201d But it was the grown-up option.TALK ABOUT A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE. She is such a queen.Seven: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I forgot THE LAW THAT MARRIED COUPLES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME IN LEVELS OF BAD-NESS you foolsTom sucks. We know this. He\u2019s a racist cheating bastard, and he\u2019s gross, and he hits Myrtle. He does plenty a\u2019 terrible thing.But guess who is not automatically responsible for his actions??? Daisy, b*tch. She totally roasts him up for his Rise of the Colored Empires pseudo-science racism. She simply does not treat people in the same way Tom does. She\u2019s not him. I don\u2019t get the grouping of them both together like it\u2019s her fault. She\u2019s totally trapped.Eight: Do we know that she knows that Gatsby died? Do we really, really, reallyyyyy know?When Nick calls her house, she\u2019s gone. Like, do we honestlyyyyyy think that the dude who picked up the phone is actually going to tell her he called? Would you be rearing to go if a person you trusted who TOTALLY ACTUALLY MANIPULATED YOU hit you up after ignoring you for weeks like YOU ARE THE VILLAIN?Honestly, there\u2019s no real sign that Daisy knew he died, but literally what did she owe him anyway. He manipulated her, lied to her, treated her like an object and nearly ruined her life. Totally made a terrible existence into full on garb\u00e0ge. Whatever, man.Nine: The car thingShe was traumatized. Gatsby orchestrated the whole cover-up. He took the wheel, he drove away, he hid the car. She had no clue the whole thing would go horribly wrong. He\u2019s the one who made all the choices in the aftermath. Duh.God this was so long. I\u2019m tired. And apologetic. Toward you, for having read a very long thing that I wrote, and toward myself, because I had to write it.This should certainly be enough to prove that Daisy Buchanan is a victim to her circumstances and otherwise noble and great and trying her goddamn best in a world in which everyone treats her like the beautiful fool she is totally not.Plus her voice is full of money.Now go off in your new happy life of being utterly enamored with Daisy Buchanan.--------------------pre-reviewDaisy Buchanan Is The Real Hero Of The Great Gatsby: A Thinkpiecewill be dropping my pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance soon(this is my attempt at a fun way of saying, \"review to come and that review will blow your mind and make you realize that daisy is the best part of this book\")"}, {"userName": "Gina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/384143-gina", "userReview": "Over drinks, I\u2019ve observed\u2014like so many smart alecks\u2014that much of The Great Gatsby\u2019s popularity relies heavily on its shortness. At a sparse 180 pages, Fitzgerald\u2019s masterpiece could be argued to be the \u201cGreat American novella.\u201d Gatsby, like so many other short classics, is easily readable, re-readable, and assessable to everyone from the attention-deficient young to mothers juggling a kid, a career, and a long-held desire to catch up on all those books \u201cthey should have read but haven\u2019t gotten around to yet\u201d.I\u2019ve now read Gatsby three times, and I admit that on my first reading during (like handfuls of others) my senior year English class, I wasn\u2019t particularly fond of the book; I believe I used the adjective \u201coverrated\u201d on numerous occasions. Daisy Buchanan seemed like a twit of a woman, and I found Jay Gatsby to be pathetically clawing in his attempt to attain her. Nick, my guide, only annoyed me further with his apparent hero-worshiping of a man I found one-dimensional and his adoration for the kind of woman I\u2019ve seen other men purport to be goddesses, but in fact, are dim-witted simpletons with nice figures. Over my two subsequent readings\u2014pushed along by friends whose judgment I trusted and who swore the book was \u201cso funny and ironic\u201d\u2014I discovered within Fitzgerald\u2019s fable a sardonic social wit and a heavily layered critique of the American Dream: the poor, working (wo)man rising above his or her social situation to discover money conquers all. Fitzgerald has a discerning ability for sharp critiques of the economically privileged and, like Jane Austin, has an ear for realistic, bantering dialogue. Through Nick\u2019s narration, we see a world that so many Americans dream of (its enviableness only further accentuated by our open disdain for it): a life of endless parties, delicious food, beautiful clothes, and Paris Hilton. Nick who\u2019s paradoxically drawn to his cousin, Daisy\u2019s, and her husband, Tom\u2019s, lifestyle with gloating contempt echoes the contemporary American idolization of an elite lifestyle that none but a select few attain. We watch Daisy with her voice that \u201csounds of money\u201d flit about with uncompromising shallowness and vivacious school-girl frivolity, and through her, see so many of the inconsequential remarks and actions others (as well as ourselves) have made for the sheer sake of \u201chaving a good time\u201d. In spite of her frivolity and weak disposition, we become, like Gatsby, \u201coverwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.\u201dThrough Gatsby\u2019s veneration of Daisy, we not only imagine what so many Americans desire (success), but also we see the goal and glittering fixation of all humanity: beauty. And like many Americans in the throes of Capitalism, Gatsby believes that money can buy beauty as well as love. Fitzgerald articulates this disillusion with haunting force, particularly voiced through Nick\u2019s obsessive repulsion with the extravagant society his social status has allowed him and the sadness he finds while watching a \u201cworking man\u201d attempt to enter it. One critique of The Great Gatsby, which could also be argued as a positive, is the limited scope of action and themes Fitzgerald chooses to encapsulate. We only see the wealthy elite (or people wanting to be the wealthy elite), and only Nick really has any depth of characterization. Unlike a tome, such as War and Peace, Gatsby fails to have numerous interwoven plotlines within a grand historical context. Yes, the Jazz Age is the novel\u2019s backdrop, but Fitzgerald fails to engage in any discussion beyond a summer among the wealthy youth partying into the wee hours of the night in the West Egg. Yet, the control with which Fitzgerald expresses his limited themes makes the novel\u2019s lack of scope forgivable.Gatsby is short and easily accessible, and I have no doubt these aspects of the novel do lend to its everlasting popularity. At the same time, it should never diminish its truly admirable ability to tease apart some of the most confounding qualities American culture values: money, beauty, youth, hard work, and the ever effusive, love."}, {"userName": "Inge", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6278820-inge", "userReview": "There was one thing I really liked about The Great Gatsby.It was short."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "Casual, self-absorbed decadence, the evaporation of social grace, money calling all the shots and memories of the past holding people hostage from the future that lies before them. Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald has nailed it and written one of THE great American novels. This book was a surprise. I LOVED it and all of the deep contradictions swimming around its heart. At once a scathing indictment on the erosion of the American Dream, but also a bittersweet love letter to the unfailing optimism of the American people. Call it dignified futility\u2026obstinate hopefulness. Whatever you call it, this novel is shiny and gorgeous, written with a sort of breezy pretension that seems to mirror the loose morality of the story. Rarely have I come across a book whose style so perfectly enhances its subject matter. Set in the eastern United States just after World War I, Fitzgerald shows us an America that has lost its moral compass. This fall from grace is demonstrated through the lives of a handful of cynical \u201cwell-to-dos\u201d living lavish but meaningless lives that focus on nothing but the pursuit of their own pleasures and whims. Standing apart from these happenings (while still being part of them) is our narrator, Nick Carraway. As the one honest and decent person in the story, Nick stands in stark contrast to the other characters. \u201cEveryone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.\u201d Nick relays the story of the summer he spent in Long Island\u2019s West Egg in a small house sandwiched between the much larger mansions of the area. His time in Long Island is spent with a group that includes his second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her rich husband Tom who live in Long Island\u2019s East Egg. At one point in the story, Nick provides the following description of the pair which I do not think can be improved upon: \n  They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.\n In addition, we have Jordan Baker who is a poster child for the pretty, amoral, self-centered rich girl whose view of the world is jaded and unsentimental. Basically, she\u2019s a bitch.The most intriguing character by far is Jay Gatsby himself, both for who he is and for how Fitzgerald develops him through the course of the narrative. When we are first introduced to Gatsby, he comes across as a polite, gracious, well-mannered gentleman with a magnetic personality who our narrator takes to immediately. \n  He had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced, or seemed to face, the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself. \n However, from that very first encounter, Fitzgerald slowly chips away at the persona and peels back the layers of the \u201cGreat\u201d Gatsby until we are left with a flawed and deeply tragic figure that in my opinion ranks among the most memorable in all of classic literature. Nick\u2019s journey in his relationship with Gatsby mirrors our own. \u201cIt is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.\u201dThrough a series of parties, affairs, beatings, drunken escapades, the lives of the characters intermesh with terrible consequences. I don\u2019t want to give away major parts of the story as I think they are best experienced for the first time fresh, but at the heart of Fitzgerald\u2019s morality tale is a tragic love that for me rivaled the emotional devastation I felt at the doomed relationship of Heathcliff and Catherine in Wuthering Heights. In general, Fitzgerald\u2019s world of excessive jubilance and debauchery is a mask that the characters wear to avoid the quiet torments that haunt them whenever they are forced to take stock of their actions. Rather than do this, they simply keep moving. \"I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others--young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.\" In the end, Fitzgerald manages the amazing feat of creating a sad, bleak portrait of America while maintaining a sense of restrained optimism in the future. Both heart-wrenching and strangely comforting at the same time. I guess in the end, this was a book that made me feel a lot and that is all I can ever ask. I\u2019m going to wrap this up with my second favorite quote from the book (my favorite being the one at the very beginning of the review): \n   And as I sat there, brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out Daisy's light at the end of his dock. He had come such a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close he could hardly fail to grasp it. But what he did not know was that it was already behind him, somewhere in the vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.\n 5.0 stars.

Yes. THE great American novel. Hmph, so I heard. I suppose it should make one more interested, or at least feel more compelled to read something (or re-read as is the case here) when it has \"classic\" and \"everyone else loves it!\" stamped all over it. And has a movie made out of it, though what beloved novel hasn't these days? Of course, I originally read FSF's Gatsby because I was expected to for a high school English class. So, even though I was never the type to do homework, I read The Great Gatsby because it had a neat cover, Fitzgerald is fun to say, and, of course, the legend of Zelda. Unfortunately for Meredyth, my thoughts on Gatsby 10 years ago are pretty similar to the thoughts I have on it today: How pretty. Pretty decedant. How drippy. How zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. It's not that I was completely uninterested. It's that my interest was never piqued to the point of really giving a shit. Sure, who doesn't love a hot mysteriously wealthy man with serious heart ache for a serious material girl? What about those rich dudes who may be crooks but no one can figger out how crooked they are exactly because how crooked can you be if you throw such mean hoedowns?! Oh, and I love a good morally ambiguous-protaganist/narrator-who-hates-parties-and-society-but-just-can't-seem-to-stay-away as much as the next person, but Nick, our hero, just wants to be liked so very much, and unfortunately, he reads like a sap. And when all the other characters are unforgivable bores, I would prefer that my ambiguous, socially mandated narrator manage to keep me awake. What about those three stars? You ask. Well I can't lie. I do think Fitz had a way with words. I did find that those subtle nuances of the variations in lifestyle during the depression to be very much in effect, and I would be happy to visit any fictional small town called West Egg. Or East Egg for that matter. And I get the kind of crazy he was going for in his more psychopathic character, George Wilson, who, because he was in love, becomes the bastiOn of normalcy even when he is driven to murder and his own suicide. FSF did manage to be believably compassionate towards his seemingly less insane characters, (who are all on the brink of insanity) (but still made me drowsy). There is definitely a part of me that sees how one could be drawn into the twinkly lit world FSF created, supposedly, out of his own reality, and I have noted his passion for the beauty of the unfolding story, such as it is. But I was disappointed 10 years ago by the story's inability to convince me it wasn't nap time, its unwillingness to point out the the relevance of the individual over society, and the irrelevance of the world Gatsby inhabits, and I was disappointed again this past week. In summation, be sure to keep an eye out for this writer. Once he writes something more appealing to the masses he's sure to bust out onto the scene soon.

There are so many great books out there that will never get the attention they deserve. They will be forgotten and their wisdom heard by only a select few who are willing to go looking for it. So it annoys me when books like this are acclaimed by critics and readers alike as the best pieces of fiction in existence (when they are not.) There\u2019s so much more out there!Anyway, rant over. The thing I like most about The Great Gatsby is the language, the subtlety\u2019s and the suggestions, the things that are not directly said but are said nevertheless. It\u2019s a true feat of writing and at times it reminded me of a stage piece. The dialogue does not give the answers, but it is the character\u2019s actions and movements (so fantastically narrated) that give the game away: it reveals their internal worlds. As such this is a book that can easily be skimmed over. The plot is basic and relatively unengaging and consequently I think an inattentive reader has a lot to miss here. It\u2019s all about illusions and false appearances just like real life. The way people perceive us is not how we truly are and sometimes individuals actively work towards creating a desired appearance for the outside world. It\u2019s easily done with enough time, effort and money. What Gatsby creates for the outside is a dream, an ideal life that looks perfect.However, scratch the surface and it is so very, very, clear that not everything is perfect. His supposed \u201chappiness\u201d is hollow and dictated by the whims of society. It is fickle, egotistical and driven by status and all the silly little symbols that go with it. His success is what society demands success to be; thus, he positions himself into a place where he can chase his true dream. In doing so Gatsby shows us that not everything is as simple as it appears, and that society driven by such monetary values is a dangerous thing because everybody is so detached from what really matters in life. (The object of his affections, for example.) I enjoyed The Great Gatsby though I certainly did not love it. Its popularity baffles me to a degree, I can think of books from the same era that deserve far more attention. Still, I enjoyed reading it and I\u2019m glad I finally did so."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/180396-jason", "userReview": "Most Americans are assigned to read this novel in high school. Few American high schoolers have the wherewithal to appreciate this novel in full. I certainly did not. It is on a shortlist of novels that should, every 5 years starting at age 25, return to any American's required reading list.First things first: The opening of The Great Gatsby -- its first 3-4 pages -- ranks among the best of any novel in the English language, and so too does its ending. Both for their content and for their prose, the latter of which is stunning and near perfect throughout the novel.As for that between the novel's opening and conclusion, two things first. (1) History is fairly clear that the term \"the American Dream\" did not exist at the time Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby, and regardless it almost certainly did not exist in the popular consciousness. (2) Few great American novelists after Fitzgerald have not attempted to write \"the great American novel\". Most of these efforts are absurdly long and often tortured. The Great Gatsby, on the other hand, is relatively short, fluid, and of seemingly effortless yet pristine expression. At a point in history where Fitzgerald's express focus could hardly have been a tale regarding \"the American dream\" per se or the writing of \"the great American novel\", Fitzgerald nevertheless crafts the definitive tale of \"the American Dream\", as well as, his successors' endeavors aside, \"the great American novel\". Period.In not so many pages, Fitzgerald paints a brilliantly cogent picture of the potential pleasures, joys, and benefits an individual might deem achievable -- uniquely so -- in an America filled with possibilities. Paired with that picture, Fitzgerald besprinkles The Great Gatsby with the numerous pitfalls and evils that both stand as a barrier to what's imagined achievable in America, and threaten to accompany that which is achieved. Neither the quest for, nor (if possible) the achievement of, the American Dream is a thing untainted. Nor, in Fitzgerald's view, can it be.Fitzgerald, frankly, writes all that need be written on this subject; whatever his successors' ambitions may be. And he writes it in prose so perfect, so impressive, and so beautiful, I occasionally find myself at a loss to name a novel in the English language constructed with greater skill, and apparent ease thereof.In short: The Great Gatsby is an inimitable wonder of American fiction. And, for lack of a better word, an \"application\" of the English language that has few equals. The novel is astounding."}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "The True Value of Monopoly MoneyCapitalism tends towards monopoly. No capitalist welcomes a competitor or rival. Having attained wealth, the desire is to retain it, not to concede it; to increase it, not to share it. A competitor is perceived as a threat, and will be treated like a virus invading an otherwise healthy, but vulnerable, body.The Great American Dream\"The Great Gatsby\" is often described as a paean to the Great American Dream.This Dream supposedly sustains the average American. It offers the opportunity to achieve success, prosperity and happiness, regardless of class, status, background or wealth.It contains a promise of upward social mobility, a reward that will be ours if we work hard enough.We all have an equal opportunity to transcend our current circumstances. Implicitly, if we fail to transcend, we have only ourselves to blame. We didn't take sufficient advantage of our opportunity. Everybody is responsible for their own failure.The Great American Dream isn't far from the Objectivist Philosophy of Ayn Rand.\n  Stars and stripes and silhouettes and shadows.Jay GatsbyMost readers think of Jay Gatsby as someone who took advantage of his opportunity, and made it.In that sense, he's the epitome of the Great American Dream.He has amassed enormous business wealth. He owns a colossal mansion on West Egg, Long Island. Every week, he holds a lavish party attended by all and sundry. The parties are the ultimate in Jazz Age glamour. Gatsby has achieved everything material an American could want. He has realised the Long Island real estate mantra, \"Vocation, Location, Ovation\".The Green LightSo what's Gatsby's problem?Every night, Gatsby looks across the sound to a green light on a porch, where Daisy lives in her more prestigious East Egg mansion with her husband, Tom Buchanan.Daisy is the one thing for which Gatsby yearns. She is the one thing he has sought after since he met and fell in love with her five years earlier at age 25.\"The Great Gatsby\" revers that small green light. What we never see is what Gatsby's mansion looked like from Daisy's perspective at home. We aren't expressly offered a vision of Gatsby's fully-lit mansion as a counterpoint to Tom's, but that is what it is.The point is Gatsby's achievement of the Great American Dream was not the end, as it is with most Americans, it was the means to an end, and that end was winning the hand in marriage of Daisy.The most important thing about Gatsby's mansion, from Gatsby's point of view, is what it would look like to one woman across the sound.Love's Labours RetrievedGatsby has already lost Daisy once, in 1917, when as a destitute young officer during the war, he was unable to marry her, because he could not offer her a financial security that was acceptable to her wealthy mid-west family.Since then, he has acquired wealth, by whatever means necessary, to win her away from Tom and marry her.The wealth was nothing to him, the parties were grotesque bonfires of vanity, designed with one thing in mind: to attract Daisy's attention and bring her, curious, within his reach.Then, having got her within his sphere of influence, he could win her back.\"The Great Gatsby\" is really about the love a man had for a woman, how he lost it and what he did to regain it.At one point, Gatsby talks about repeating the past. I don't see him as repeating it, so much as regaining it, making up for lost time, retrieving what he felt should have been his.\"The Great Gatsby\" is not so much about repetition, as it is about retrieval; not so much a remembrance of things past, as a resumption of a journey from a point in the past when the journey was broken.Carey Mulligan as Daisy (Courtesy: The Telegraph)The Pursuit of Another Man's WifeAt its heart, Gatsby engages in adultery with Daisy, with a view to convincing her to divorce Tom and marry him.Many might find his conduct objectionable, except that he is young, elegant, good-looking, fabulously wealthy and, most importantly, in love with the slender Daisy.In contrast, Tom is a brute of a man, he is an ex-champion footballer, hard and cruel. Most importantly, he has cheated on Daisy many times and now has a mistress, the stout, but sensuous, Myrtle Wilson.Tom comes from an extremely wealthy mid-western family. Money is no object to him. Daisy might have the voice of money, but Tom has the demeanour and arrogance of not just money, but old money.When Tom learns of Daisy's infidelity and Gatsby's takeover bid, he goes into typical capitalist mode in order to defend his wife, his asset, his marital property.He researches Gatsby's past and theorises about how he has made his new money. He plans his counter-attack.The narrator, Nick Carraway, watches on, not just witness to a battle between Good and Evil, but in reality a battle between two degrees of bad.Black and white portrait of Isla Fisher as Myrtle WilsonTom's Defence StrategyIn the realm of love, as between two rival men, there can be no such thing as a friendly takeover bid.There is no suggestion that Tom can allow Gatsby to have Daisy, so that he can settle for Myrtle. The latter is just a plaything, something he spends time on, because she is available and he can have her without effort. All Myrtle ever wanted from her own husband was a gentleman with breeding. He turns out to be a mere mechanic and car salesman. He doesn't have the right status. Equally, although he is content to have her as his mistress, Tom doesn't see Myrtle as having the right status for marriage either.Ultimately, the role of marriage is not to perpetuate love and happiness. Tom's task is to bond together two wealthy establishment families and their riches. A merger of two capitalist families moves them that much closer to monopolistic power, in the same way that the intermarriage of royal families once cemented international power.Tom's goal is so important that it can accommodate his cruelty and infidelities, at least in his eyes.Moreover, it allows Tom to prevail over Gatsby, who, despite his war record, his partly-completed Oxford education, his wealth, his glamour, and his apparent achievement of the Great American Dream, is not \"one of us\".Ultimately, coincidence, accident and fate intervene on behalf of Tom, almost comically if it was not so sad, and he resists Gatsby's takeover bid.Nick, the observer, the witness, the audience of this tragedy, is left disgusted.Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan BakerThe Great American Paradox\"The Great Gatsby\" is a short novel. At times, there is more telling than showing. At times, the description is too adjectival or adverbial for the dictates of current style manuals.Take away the mansion, the parties and the glamour, and what remains comes close to the dimensions of film noir like \"Double Indemnity\".While the novel is perceived as hailing the Great American Dream, the paradox is that it highlights how great are the forces that are lined up to resist the efforts of a man who aspires to the Dream, especially if that man is a trespasser who covets another man's wife, even if he loves her and she loves him.There are flaws in Fitzgerald's writing, but they are tolerable. The story is magificent, even if, when laid out methodically, it might appear cliched. The characters, while realistic, are detailed and larger than life, certainly detailed enough to withstand the scrutiny when they are projected onto the silver screen. They are portrayed acting out their emotions in exactly the same way that we might in the same circumstances.However, in the long run, what makes \"The Great Gatsby\" great is Fitzgerald's ability to both adulate and perpetuate the Great American Dream, while simultaneously subverting it."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Masterson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28953843-jennifer-masterson", "userReview": "I just spent three days being read to by Jake Gyllenhaal and it was absolutely wonderful!

The Great Gatsby, F. Scott FitzgeraldThe Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. Characters: Nick Carraway, Jay Gatsby, Daisy Buchanan, Tom Buchanan, Jordan Baker, Myrtle Wilson, Meyer Wolfsheim, George Wilson.\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6313408-jonathan-terrington", "userReview": "My essay on The Great Gatsby and reificationWhat is there to love about The Great Gatsby?F.Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s writing here leaves only a little to be desired. The characters themselves seem shallow and empty, lacking in morality and you could take all this into consideration and instantly report: \u2018well that\u2019s a shallow book if ever I\u2019ve heard of one.\u2019 However it can also be seen that, The Great Gatsby is a scathing social commentary that explores the fruitlessness of pursuing dreams. Particularly dreams that are nothing more than shadows. To that end The Great Gatsby is a brilliant piece of fiction designed to criticise the lack of morality among its rich and selfish inhabitants who parasitically devour the work of the poor.One of the most beautiful elements in this novel is the depiction of the Valley of Ashes, which ultimately all the characters pass through regardless of being rich or poor. It is a place of equality and reminds one of the idea of the \u2018Valley of the Shadow of Death\u2019 mentioned by the Psalmist David, and in the novel itself Wilson relates those giant eyes to the eyes of God, a God who sees all that men do. Which is such a brilliant image to present to the reader. It is imagery like this that haunts one far after finishing this novel. Imagery remembered emphatically.It is also the language of Fitzgerald\u2019s work that draws one in. It may not always be flawless writing but it is vivid and alive. Fitzgerald\u2019s is essentially thoughtful writing. It is the language of quotes that act as prison bars to keep the reader enthralled by the novel.\u201cIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I\u2019ve been turning over in my mind ever since.\u2018Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\u2019 he told me, \u2018just remember that all the people in this world haven\u2019t had the advantages that you\u2019ve had.\u2019\u201dOf course The Great Gatsby will always be a polarising text due to its characters and the debate about whether it is truly a novel about the American Dream. It is a polarising effect that stems from the allure of the book \u2013 the way in which the novel hauntingly hints at something greater while remaining so brilliantly flawed. One certainly cannot fully explain their own fascination with the book, save that it does that rare thing that strong literature should do. It serves, as Franz Kafka said, to be \u201cthe axe for the frozen sea within us.\u201d An axe in a forest of frozen dreams \u2013 poetically carving up a vision of one man forever haunted by the failings of his own dream.The rest of this review has been moved over to my website,  click right here if you would like to read the rest of the review."}, {"userName": "Clau R.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13061577-clau-r", "userReview": "Se me olvid\u00f3 actualizar la info de este libro en GR, oops.

Ma il cinema per gli US (e per noi italiani) \u00e8 la forma d\u2019arte esportata meglio nel corso del Novecento, quella che si \u00e8 diffusa di pi\u00f9, \u00e8 diventata pi\u00f9 famosa. Fitzgerald anche in questo seppe cogliere l\u2019aria del tempo (e poi restare eterno come solo i classici possono).Il primo adattamento per lo schermo apparve a un solo anno di distanza dalla prima pubblicazione, 1926, film muto, con Warner Baxter nel ruolo del titolo, Lois Wilson in Daisy, e Neil Hamilton in Nick. La regia di Herbert Brenon. Il film fu un fiasco, come tutti gli altri che seguirono nel tempo. Fitzgerald e sua moglie Zelda detestarono questo primo adattamento e uscirono dalla sala prima della fine della proiezione. Di questo film \u00e8 rimasto solo il trailer, il resto si \u00e8 dissolto.Cinematografico non solo nell\u2019attenzione alle luci: le finestre, aperte e chiuse, i controluce, i colori (il verde della luce del faro, il giallo della macchina e degli occhiali, il rosa e l\u2019oro degli abiti di Gatsby, l\u2019oro della ricchezza, l\u2019azzurro dei prati, l\u2019argento della luna\u2026) - pure se all\u2019epoca la pellicola era ancora in bianco e nero, la realt\u00e0 ricostruita nei set era ovviamente colorata. Squisitamente cinematografica la prima apparizione di Gatsby, in silhouette, uscito per decidere quanto gli spettasse del nostro cielo, protende il braccio verso la luce verde al di l\u00e0 della baia, il faro davanti alla casa di Daisy (questa luce verde ritorna pi\u00f9 volte nel romanzo, diventa il simbolo della ricerca di Gatsby, del sogno individuale e collettivo, infatti \u00e8 lo stesso verde che appare ai primi marinai che raggiunsero la costa americana, loro s\u00ec inseguirono il sogno diretti da est a ovest).Ma, l\u2019effettiva entrata in scena di Gatsby \u00e8 articolata in un crescendo, per i primi due capitoli e met\u00e0 del terzo, come l\u2019ingresso della primadonna. Preparata dalle voci (\u2026\u00e8 parente del Kaiser\u2026 ha ucciso un uomo\u2026 \u00e8 cugino di secondo grado del diavolo\u2026), dalle chiacchiere, dai mormorii, la curiosit\u00e0 sale nel protagonista io narrante e nel lettore (sicuramente nel sottoscritto lettore).E poi, colpo di genio, Gatsby all\u2019improvviso \u00e8 gi\u00e0 in scena: niente occhio di bue, niente rullo di tamburi, accanto a Nick, il nostro Virgilio in questa divina tragedia americana, \u00e8 seduto un uomo di qualche anno pi\u00f9 grande di lui, che parla con cura e formalit\u00e0, probabilmente un ex commilitone durante la Grande Guerra. Ed \u00e8 proprio lui, Gatsby, il mitico grande Gatsby, colui che dispensava la luce delle stelle a falene indifferenti.Sempre in bianco e nero, ma in sonoro, si comincia a entrare nel mito, con Alan Ladd nella parte di Gatsby, Betty Field per Daisy, e Macdonald Carey che fa Nick. Dirige Elliott Nugent. \u00c8 il 1949, e anche questo film incassa male, la maledizione di Gatsby contagia lo schermo.Esistono molti tipi di sorriso: quello di Gatsby per\u00f2 \u00e8 unico, e FSF lo descrive a meraviglia. Dimentica tuttavia di dirci la cosa che spiega tutto: non basta scrivere che era uno di quei rari sorrisi capaci di rassicurazione eterna, come si incontrano quattro o cinque volte nella vita - il sorriso di Gatsby era uno di quei sorrisi che ti fanno sentire importante. Prima di tutto proprio per il fatto che sia uno come Gatsby a sorriderti. Quel genere di sorriso che si accompagna quasi sempre a laconicit\u00e0. Perch\u00e9 a quel sorriso si affida l\u2019essenza della comunicazione.Ed eccoci alla versione del 1974, con la star delle star, Robert Redford [che quest\u2019anno ne fa ha 81, e quando lui non ci sar\u00e0 pi\u00f9, per me non esister\u00e0 pi\u00f9 neanche Hollywood], Mia Farrow, Sam Waterston, Bruce Dern, Karen Black, Lois Chiles. Firma Jack Clayton, che rifiuta la sceneggiatura di Truman Capote e opta per quella di Francis Ford Coppola. Il film finalmente incassa, ma l\u2019alchimia Redford-Farrow \u00e8 sotto zero. Clayton non raggiunge purtroppo le vette di The Innocents (in italiano: Suspense, 1961), l\u2019adattamento di \u2018Giro di vite\u2019 di Henry James.Sempre per restare nell\u2019ambito cinematografico, Nick, l\u2019io narrante \u00e8 al contempo regista e interprete/testimone, racconta ci\u00f2 che vede, assiste e partecipa, ma anche ci\u00f2 che ha sentito, ricostruendo l\u2019intreccio per noi lettori come farebbe una voce fuori campo. Fitzgerald glielo lascia fare in modo che la storia e il personaggio principale siano costruiti su vuoti ed ellissi, elementi strutturali quanto mai filmici \u2013 alcuni degli eventi fondamentali del romanzo non sono messi in scena, non sono rappresentati: per esempio, l\u2019incontro tra Gatsby e Daisy, l\u2019investimento di Myrtle, la morte di Gatsby, tutti momenti clou che rimangono per cos\u00ec dire \u2018fuori campo\u2019.Nick \u00e8 il punto di vista dominante, ma \u00e8 qualcuno che ammette di essere allo stesso tempo dentro e fuori i fatti, \u00e8 qualcuno che ci dice esplicitamente quanto il suo racconto sia in soggettiva piuttosto che oggettivo - per questo non si trattiene dal manipolare il piano temporale dei fatti, l\u2019ordine degli eventi, spostandosi avanti e indietro nel tempo, proprio come farebbe un regista in fase di montaggio. E proprio come un regista che interviene sulla lente e gioca con la messa a fuoco, la percezione visiva di Nick \u00e8 spesso annebbiata, distorta, come sottolineano i molteplici riferimenti alla vista, allo sguardo, al punto di vista, all\u2019illusione ottica (lo stesso passato di Gatsby riassume in s\u00e9 contorni sfumati e incerti). In contrapposizione allo sguardo del grande manifesto pubblicitario che ritorna pi\u00f9 volte, quello del dott. J.T. Eckleburg, che dietro i giganteschi occhiali nasconde quasi sicuramente gli occhi miopi di dio (metafora della cecit\u00e0 eterna, la pubblicit\u00e0 mercifica il divino).Questa versione nasce modesta, destinata alla tv: \u00e8 il 2000, Toby Stephens interpreta Gatsby, Mira Sorvino Daisy e Paul Rudd Nick. Dirige Robert Markowitz.Alla ricerca dell\u2019ultima frontiera, il confine da Ovest si \u00e8 spostato a Est, e in questa terra di conquista dove il sogno di felicit\u00e0 e redenzione \u00e8 universale ed eterno, in questa vicenda semplice, per certi versi addirittura banale, eppure complessa e intricata come solo i grandi classici possono essere, in queste pagine che sono simboliche e mitiche, americane al cento per cento (Under the Red, White, and Blue sembra che fosse il titolo preferito da Fitzgerald, lo propose all\u2019editore troppo tardi, l\u2019opera era gi\u00e0 in stampa) ma universali, il sogno \u00e8 destinato a fallire. Gatsby \u00e8 un cavaliere medioevale senza armatura che insegue il suo sogno, il suo Santo Graal che si chiama Daisy, ma si chiama anche successo, perch\u00e9 senza successo Daisy non si trova, non arriva. Il sogno americano \u00e8 gi\u00e0 marcio negli anni Venti del Novecento, quando \u00e8 ambientato questo romanzo: il proibizionismo stimola e diffonde corruzione, il successo arriva in fretta con metodi spicci, non serve pi\u00f9 il duro lavoro. Anche se si arriva in cima, ci si muove in una terra desolata come quella che circonda il drugstore del marito di Myrtle, dove la donna viene travolta e uccisa, mischiando il suo sangue alla cenere, e in ultima analisi all\u2019immondizia. Proprio come Lancillotto, il pi\u00f9 celebre cavaliere medievale, Gatsby conosce l\u2019amore sia romantico che fisico (non credo di aver mai letto una scena d\u2019amore pi\u00f9 erotica di quella descritta da Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes tra Lancillotto e Ginevra).On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along shore the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby\u2019s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn. Un esempio dell\u2019incanto che \u00e8 una grande scrittura.Nel 2002 ci fu uno strano tentativo, Gatsby diventa nero in questo insolito remake che trasporta la storia al terzo millennio: si intitola semplicemente G, dirige Christopher Scott Cherot, e Richard T.Jones interpreta il protagonista Summer G. Esperimento curioso, ma non indimenticabile.Nel 1922, quando inizi\u00f2 a pensare al romanzo che ultim\u00f2 e fu pubblicato tre anni dopo, Fitzgerald scrisse al suo editor: Voglio scrivere qualcosa di nuovo - qualcosa di straordinario, di bello e semplice e dalla struttura intricata. Parole che sono cronaca di un capolavoro annunciato.Figlio di Henry James, o come disse T.S.Eliot, il primo passo in avanti fatto dalla narrativa americana dai tempi di Henry James, mi piace pensare che Fitzgerald battezz\u00f2 la sua non eroina ispirandosi proprio alla Daisy Miller di James.Figlio della grande tradizione, dove Nick sopravvive alla morte di Gatsby per raccontare la storia proprio come Ismael sopravvive alla tragedia di Achab, Fitzgerald seppe spostare l\u2019asticella pi\u00f9 in alto, pi\u00f9 avanti. Cos\u00ec in alto e cos\u00ec avanti che un altro sommo scrittore, J.D. Salinger, fa pronunciare al suo incomparabile personaggio, Holden, catcher in the rye, parole di lode per Fitzgerald e il suo Gatsby (Mi fa impazzire, Il Grande Gatsby. Il vecchio Gatsby. Vecchio mio. Mi fa morire, capitolo 18). E come Nick alla fine del romanzo pulisce una parola oscena scritta sui gradini della villa di Gatsby, cos\u00ec Holden cancella le oscenit\u00e0 scritte sui muri della scuola della sorellina.A questo punto mi piace citare Calvino, le cui parole trovo particolarmente adatte a questo capolavoro: un classico \u00e8 un libro che non ha mai finito di dire quel che ha da dire - Di un classico ogni rilettura \u00e8 una lettura di scoperta come la prima - I classici sono libri che quanto pi\u00f9 si crede di conoscerli per sentito dire, tanto pi\u00f9 quando si leggono davvero si trovano nuovi, inaspettati, inediti - Un classico \u00e8 un'opera che provoca incessantemente un pulviscolo di discorsi critici su di s\u00e9, ma continuamente se li scrolla di dosso\u2026Ed ecco l\u2019ultima leggenda, Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan in Daisy, e Tobey Maguire fa Nick. La regia \u00e8 affidata al geniale Baz Luhrmann. Siamo nel 2013. Il risultato non \u00e8 memorabile.Tentai poi di pensare a Gatsby per un momento ma lui era gi\u00e0 troppo lontano.Probabilmente non avevo diciotto anni quando ho letto Fitzgerald per la prima volta. I 28 racconti. Il primo, \u2018Il diamante grosso come l\u2019Hotel Ritz\u2019, mi fulmin\u00f2 e mi conquist\u00f2 col suo finale: I don't know any longer. At any rate, let us love for a while, for a year or so, you and me. That's a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try. There are only diamonds in the whole world, diamonds and perhaps the shabby gift of disillusion. Well, I have that last and I will make the usual nothing of it.\" He shivered. \"Turn up your coat collar, little girl, the night's full of chill and you'll get pneumonia.

F. Scott Fitzgerald weaves them tragically together in this perfectly plotted masterpiece.Every scene is unforgettable--so distinct and unique--from the grandest party ever recorded, to the most tense fight ever written, to the most perfectly dark twisted love affair of all time, to the most pathetically sad funeral imaginable.When people say this is the best book ever written, they're not kidding. It's so good that almost daily I wish I could experience this for the first time again.What really makes The Great Gatsby unique is that EVERYONE at some point in life wants to be great in just the way that Jay does--for reasons more or less the same. We all have this implicit desire to get the validation from others that we're acceptable, and so at some point most of us turn to wanting to be \"great\"--but just for the sake of it. Combine that with the fact that all the characters are despicable--but so well written that you can't help but root for them and grow emotionally attached to them--and also how effortlessly the words transport you back in time, and The Great Gatsby truly becomes a one-of-a-kind story.Then there's the love story in which someone as mystically personable as Jay Gatsby falls for someone as pathetically self-centered and stupid as Daisy Buchanan. It's equal parts realistic, depressing, twisted, and somehow reassuring. We've all fallen for that one person we know there's no reason. This is the greatest case of that ever devised.How F. Scott Fitzgerald accomplishes all this in such few pages is truly astounding."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "This is an all right-ish kind of novel, I suppose, but I always preferred Fitzgerald\u2019s little-known prequel The Average Gatsby, although some people found the vision of Mervyn Gatsby, Jay\u2019s obscure brother, living a reasonably okayish life as the manager of a carpet and upholstery warehouse in Des Moines a trifle dispiriting. I quite agree that The Bad Gatsby was a shameless self-ripoff which did Fitzgerald no favours. (The threesome scene between Warren Harding, John Dillinger and Gatsby was in poor taste and I do not see how it got past the censor. I have never been able to look at a set of deer antlers without blushing ever again.) And I must say that these new franchised-out novels like The Late Gatsby (Jay as vampire, inevitable I suppose),  The Grape Gatsby (must be aimed at the vegan crowd) and The Lesbian Gatsby (in which \u2013 surprise \u2013 he never was a man), followed up by The Straight Gatsby - and The Groped Gatsby in which he was recovering from sexual abuse at the hands of Warren Harding - what can one say - The Ingrate Gatsby (in which he doesn't get rich and is really bitter) - must have literature fans gnawing each other\u2019s kindles in sheer angst.

I'm still not overly enamoured with Modern Classics (though they tend to be a lot shorter than Victorian Classics are, which can come as a relief) but I am thoroughly enjoying the journey through the genre.This book was quite a disappointment and not a surprise at the same time. I knew I wasn't going to love it before I went in to it, though I don't know why. I had no preconceptions of this book: I've never seen the film and I haven't ever read a blurb about it. My copy doesn't have one. I just knew I wouldn't love it.I didn't think I wouldn't like it, though. I can't really think of any specifics, I just didn't like the plot, the characters or the setting at all. There were some fun moments, some dire moments and just a whole lot of dullness going around. It's hard to really enjoy something if you don't feel any sympathy or empathy with the characters, not even mentioning that ever-present idea that we need to identify with characters, too. I also found that this book wasn't particularly American, or particularly 20s, or particularly anything at all, really. It was just a kind of story with a kind of moral to it.The one thing I will say about this: F. Scott is a wonderful writer. I kind of thought this before I went in, but I never really knew until I found I was re-reading sentences over and over again just to re-live them. Not what they were saying, or what they were telling, or showing, or portraying, or anything like that, but just the words used and in which order. Sometimes it felt like magic. I will definitely read more F. Scott, but this one really isn't great at all. But that's okay.

Nick, Daisy's cousin, arrives in town and through him, reunites Gatsby with his former girlfriend, she enjoys luxury, which is why Daisy married rich Tom and not poor Jay. A catastrophic car accident kills Tom's girlfriend, yes, he's a creep but a wealthy one, it's vague who's responsible, but her husband thinks he knows. Death in a swimming pool, ends this tragedy and symbolizes the Jazz Age ... Thoughts: Gatsby was a tortured, lonely man, even shy, who tried to become a member of the establishment. He, with all his riches, needed to enter it, to become part of it, to feel alive but could never remove the dirt and his lowly, and embarrassing origins. They (the upper class), used him and laughed at the stranger behind his back, and the illusions about Daisy , a woman who never really existed, except in his distorted mind. The truth shocked Gatsby, the pretend gentleman but he could never let go of the mirage, if he did, there would be nothing left of his soul."}, {"userName": "Rolls", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18657-rolls", "userReview": "\"The Great Gatsby\" is considered by many to be the zenith of American fiction writing in the last century. I won't say that it is the best American novel I've read but I will say it is probably the most perfect.Along with J.D. Salinger, Fitzgerald has got to be my favorite writer of fiction. As opposed to Hemingway's bluntness, and Faulkner's artiness, Fitzgerald's prose seems(to paraphrase Michael Chabon) to rain down from style heaven. His style in fact is like the ladies he writes about: cool, lean and absolutely enchanting. He would never dream of overwriting and knows exactly when to hold back for maximum effect. His use of the language is assured and consequently eminently readable. For that alone this should be considered the Mona Lisa of prose.What is astounding though is how he puts his sparsely elegant style to use giving his characters shade and depth. Fitzgerald is a true student of humanity and his skills of observation are razor sharp. He sums up his characters in sentences that read like aphorisms bulging with truth about the human condition. There's not a page goes by I'm not gasping at the depth of his vision and the economy he uses to express it.So far I've dwelt on how he wrote and not on what he wrote. People who'd back another nag in the Great American Novel derby knock Fitzgerald's sophomoric (their word not mine) obsession with romance between men and women. They reduce his works to the level of melodramatic tear jerkers. This is a gross simplification of his talents. Yes \"Gatsby\" focuses on a doomed love affair but it does so to illustrate the errors in thinking that he felt marred his generation. Gatsby is about the hollowness of the American dream as dreamt in the twenties. Fitzgerald looked around him (and in the mirror)and saw men and women locked in a frenzied and ultimatley doomed race for speed, money and sin. Gatsby and Daisy's love is doomed because their values have been distorted by money and comfort and opulence. They cannot see the depths because they are too easily distracted by shiny surfaces. When Daisy cries as Gatsby shows off his elegantly tailored shirts because she has never seen clothes so beautiful sums up perfectly how for her exteriors matter most. This is at the heart of the tragedy that unfolds before us in this delicious little novel.There is no denying this is one of the GREAT BOOKS. If you haven't read it do so. I dare you to not fall in love with it."}, {"userName": "Luca Ambrosino", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53478239-luca-ambrosino", "userReview": "English (The Great Gatsby) / Italiano\u00abIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I\u2019ve been turning over in my mind ever since. \u201cWhenever you feel like criticizing any one,\u201d he told me, \u201cjust remember that all the people in this world haven\u2019t had the advantages that you\u2019ve had.\u201d\u00bbThe Great Gatsby, the book that most of all I postponed the reading. There was something in the title that didn't excite me, that didn't pass the smell. I was wrong.The narrator, Nick Carraway, lives in a house across the street of the luxurious villa of Jay Gatsby, the embodiment of the American Dream. Nick is affected by Gatsby straight away, and starts a friendship with him, helping him to win back the love of an old flame, that is married by now.The novel is poetic at times, often cynical, with an enjoyable style of writing. The lesson is ruthless: the American Dream is exactly what it is. It is not real, it's only a dream.Vote: 8\u00abNei miei anni pi\u00f9 giovani e vulnerabili mio padre mi diede un consiglio che non ho mai smesso di considerare. \u201cOgni volta che ti sentirai di criticare qualcuno,\u201d mi disse, \u201cricordati che non tutti a questo mondo hanno avuto i tuoi stessi vantaggi\u201d\u00bbIl Grande Gatsby, il libro che pi\u00f9 di tutti non mi decidevo a leggere.

Beneath the shimmering surface of his life, Gatsby is hiding a secret: a silent longing that can never be fulfilled. And soon, this destructive obsession will force his world to unravel.In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald brilliantly captures both the disillusionment of post-war America and the moral failure of a society obsessed with wealth and status.
