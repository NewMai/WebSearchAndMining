Gwen suddenly finds herself the beneficiary of a vacation in Europe complete with scenic and historic sites and in the company of Aunt Bea\u2019s quirky friends and members of her S&M (Sudoku and Math-jongg) club. But something profound happened to this regimented life on this very free spirited journey and as Gwen travels a road she\u2019s unfamiliar with she learns something about herself that was hidden beneath that fa\u00e7ade of uniformity, even more surprising is that she\u2019s not the only one on a path of discovery. Emerson Edwards and his brother, Thoreau, meet the group in Italy and throw a wrench in Gwen\u2019s well-oiled life with their intelligence and their irreverence.There are consequences that come with discovery and it\u2019s as these two very different roads connect that Gwen will find out if the fear of her past will dictate her future.This is a brilliant piece of contemporary literature, it\u2019s timeless in its essence. Ms. Brant brings us a rather later that usual coming of age in this story of a woman who\u2019s life has been ruled by loss and fear, then she gives us the hope that this new woman can come out of her chrysalis in tact and ready to take on her whole new world. She does this with her customary prose like dialogue and a narrative that will take your breath away as she takes us through Europe that can vividly be seen in your mind\u2019s eye. Her characters are superstars, every one of them from the 90 year old feisty Zenia to the 15 year old Ani and all the ones in between. But it\u2019s Gwen who shines the brightest, who we will cry with and cry for, who we will root for and scold who we will want for most of all as we see her evolve throughout the novel. Is it a love story, yes it is, but not just a romance, it\u2019s the love of one\u2019s self, of familial and friend love and of course also that love that makes the world go round, the kind of love that heats the coldest of nights and fills the emptiest of rooms. This is your first must read of December and you\u2019ll want to share with the people who mean the most to you, a perfect stocking stuffer and yes it wraps beautifully. It\u2019s also a read that will be enjoyed by multi-generations and both sexes. If this is your first trip with Marilyn Brant I know it won\u2019t be your last.Thank you Ms. Brant for another exceptional read."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1310192-susan", "userReview": "Those who loved Marilyn Brant's earlier books (ACCORDING TO JANE and FRIDAY MORNINGS AT NINE) are going to adore A SUMMER IN EUROPE (November 2011).

As Gwendolyn Reese turns thirty and contemplates her life experiences, she considers the orderly manner in which she goes through each day to be her safety net. Her mother's sudden death at age forty had left Gwen shaken and in need of the pedestrian reliability of a structured existence. With her mother's passing, Gwen assumed the responsibility of caring for her father and two younger brothers. Later, she finds some sense of satisfaction in her teaching career, and her love of music is a source of pleasure. Expecting her boyfriend, Richard, to propose, she is taken aback when he postpones making the commitment. Gwen's lively Aunt Bea, sister of Gwen's late mother, offers her a chance of a lifetime--to join her and the members of her S&M Club for a summer-long tour of Europe. \"S&M\" stands for sudoku and mahjongg, and Aunt Bea and her friends are die-hard devotees of the games. At first, Gwen feels awkward and out-of-place, intimidated by the timeless culture of her surroundings and the intellect and sophistication of some of the fellow travelers she meets along the way. However, as time passes, Gwen begins to absorb the sights and sounds and tastes and textures of each place that they visit. The more she takes in, the lighter she begins to feel, shedding the repression of her inhibitions. Her attention is captured and held by two charming and intelligent brothers, Emerson and Thoreau, whose main goal in life seems to be one-upping each other at every opportunity. It is Emerson to whom she is most drawn, and when he makes it clear that he returns her interest, her emotions take an unexpected turn. Still involved with Richard, she is not free to begin a relationship with Emerson, but her heart speaks a different language. When Richard unexpectedly joins her near the end of her grand tour, she must face her real feelings about life and love. Will she learn to let go and take a leap of faith, or will she return to the known comfort of the cocoon of her orderly world? The author's great love of Europe and her extensive travels there are evident in her delightful, irresistible descriptions of the beauty and bountiful offerings to be found throughout the European continent. The subtle, insightful way with which Marilyn Brant has crafted Gwen's story will make you feel as if you are experiencing everything right beside Gwen. You will breathe the air, inhale the intoxicating aromas, and be enchanted by the art and music and flow of languages. You will taste all the fantastic flavors of gelato, savor the linguine with meat sauce and the variety of quiches, and feel lust in your heart for the fabulous pastries and artisan chocolates. Perhaps the Sachertorte will be your undoing. A layered chocolate cake is filled with apricot jam, coated in chocolate ganache, and then finished with a chocolate glaze. The flavors are then immeasurably enhanced by the giving and receiving of forkfuls of said cake between two people caught up in the spell of the love of a lifetime. Like me, you may never see your travel dreams come to fruition, but thanks to Marilyn Brant, you will always have the pleasure of \"A Summer in Europe\".

And that even though you believe everything in life is set up as precisely as a business spreadsheet, there are aspects of adventure, thrills and romance that can come along out of nowhere and really open your eyes.Gwen Reese is our main character. Gwen is one of those women who measures out what to put in her cereal bowl in the morning, she is that precise. Her boyfriend of two years has asked her to lunch on this, her thirtieth birthday, and Gwen has prepared herself to believe that this is the moment where he will propose. She expects a diamond. Unfortunately what she receives are pearl earrings (that she doesn\u2019t want because she always wears the pearl earrings that belonged to her beloved mother who passed away), a drab lunch, and a so-so promise from her nerd boyfriend that perhaps they can think about marriage in the Fall.Feeling more than a bit upset, Gwen heads to her Aunt Bea\u2019s house - and this is a woman who is truly hysterical. She has a group of friends - locally, and abroad that she speaks to over the internet - and they all form the S&M Club (meaning Sudoku and Mahjongg). This group is absolutely adorable, and their jokes are something all readers will remember. They surprise Gwen with a birthday present - a whirlwind trip to Europe that will begin in just two days. With no time to think, Gwen heads to the airport with Aunt Bea and friends, hoping that by getting away from her boring, hum-drum life, she can make more sense of it.Europe is truly stunning. From Rome to southern Italy; from Capri to the Matterhorn, to looking at the slightly \u2018steamy\u2019 art in Pompeii - Gwen does her best to enjoy the trip, although her elders seem to be having a lot more fun than she is. It isn\u2019t until a set of brothers joins the tour that Gwen\u2019s destiny begins to be unveiled.The brothers are named Emerson and Thoreau and they love to boast and brag and \u2018one-up\u2019 each other as much as possible. One is a psychologist and one is a physicist, and they have incredible brains to go with their incredible biceps. As the lovely vistas go by, Emerson and Gwen find themselves getting closer, although Gwen knows that back home her boyfriend awaits.This is truly a well-written romance that beautifully proves that time is fluid, and that no matter what, you can ALWAYS start on a brand new chapter of your life and find your soul mate in the oddest of places. An invigorating and inspirational plot blended with humor, fun and romance - a perfect recipe!"}, {"userName": "Jakki", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6653630-jakki", "userReview": "For her thirtieth birthday, Gwendolyn Reese doesn\u2019t receive the expected engagement ring from her boyfriend. Instead, her aunt and the Sudoku and Mahjongg Club present Gwen with a grand tour of Europe. With no ring, Gwen decides to go abroad, her first step in finding herself. Having rarely left the comfort of the Midwest, and uncertain as to whether she is up to spending a summer with her aunt\u2019s crazy friends, Gwen is apprehensive. Yet, it is somewhere between Capri and Sorrento that Gwen has her great awakening. Everything now is vivid, vibrant, and alive; she is alive.Helping her along is physics professor Emerson Edwards. However, the more time Gwen spends in Emerson\u2019s company, the greater her struggle becomes, as her new passion for culture is not the only awakening Gwen is having. Even though things may be platonic between the two, there\u2019s no getting around the sparks flying from all the sexual tension. From feeding each other linguini and chocolate cake to their unique understanding for each other, I was completely wrapped up in their story. But will Gwen\u2019s renaissance take root enough for her to forget the safety and predictability of life back in Iowa with her boyfriend Richard or will she take a chance in her search for her own passions?Adding to the amusement of the story was the S&M Club. It didn\u2019t matter if Hester, Zenia and Aunt Bea were discussing The Bold and the Beautiful, which men are \u201cfling-worthy,\u201d or a new way to dispose of someone as a plot for a novel, they had me in stitches. I mean, who expects a sixty-seven year old aunt to encourage her niece to \u201close\u201d her hotel key so she will have no other choice than to spend the night elsewhere?A Summer in Europe was truly an enjoyable novel. I found Brant\u2019s storytelling supreme, her characters real, and Europe breathtaking. In addition to the lovable characters, it was the author\u2019s picturesque language that had me experiencing Gwen\u2019s awakening and Europe first hand. Brant\u2019s ability to take the smallest details and tie them into the major themes and motifs, as well as her perfectly chosen descriptions, wove this story together like one of Zenia\u2019s finely knitted scarves.I was not ready to say good-bye to my new friends or to unpack my bags and put away my passport.

Like Gwen, I\u2019m hardly a world traveler, so I enjoyed sharing all of her travel firsts (and I enjoyed reading my first Marilyn Brant book.Pros of A SUMMER IN EUROPE:* Brant\u2019s kooky characters. I loved them all from the 90-year-old who wants to write a thriller and keeps sharing her murderous plots with her fellow travelers to the handsome Austrian tour guide suffering separation anxiety from his beloved pet hamster. * On a related note, the book has a fair number of characters, which tends to be dangerous in fiction, but Brant pulls it off. Everyone is distinct enough that the reader is not left confused. *The best heroes are English. This is not up for debate, folks.*At times, laugh out loud funny.*Armchair travel at its best. I especially loved the scenes in Italy.*The book description sounds fluffy, but it\u2019s actually a pretty thoughtful book. Cons of A SUMMER IN EUROPE:*Not the most original premise. We\u2019ve all read about the woman who goes to Europe when a relationship doesn\u2019t go as planned. The journey itself is wonderful, but it still begins in an expected place, and for that matter, ends in an expected place. *Gwen is a little too uptight in the beginning, and it made her a little difficult to relate to initially.*Sometimes the book (or Gwen?) tells the reader too much instead of letting the reader draw his/her own conclusions.As you can see from my rating, the pros won out over the cons for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed this.

It just goes to show you that no matter what age you are, you can be into S and M (sudoku and mah-jongg that is). In the beginning, I was not feeling Gwen so much. She was in Europe and all she wanted to do is complain and compare the dashing, and nice Emerson to douche-bag, Richard. I felt myself getting turned off by Gwen and yelling at her to let her hair down and have fun. Her Aunt and everyone else are. Thus, due to Gwen being so uptight in the beginning, I was not seeing the chemistry involving Gwen and Emerson. After Gwen did loosen up, I thought she and Emerson made a cute couple.

Wait a minute, you're saying to yourself. Did you just say \"A Summer in Europe\" is a perfect Holiday read?? Why, yes, my friends, I did.Protagonist Gwen Reese likes things a certain way. From her bran cereal to her boyfriend to her exercise routine, she likes order and stability. Her Aunt Bea, however, does not. So when Gwen's straight-laced boyfriend suggests they take a break, Gwen reluctantly takes Bea up on an offer of a month-long vacation in Europe. And that is where our love story begins.It's a great romance, filled with all the usual things accompanying first loves. Quickening pulses, fluttering heartbeats, uncontrollable smiles, but this love affair is one between Gwen and her life. Gwen's voyage of self-discovery is one we've all taken at one time or another. It is the moment we all come to when you have to look deep within yourself and ask: Who the hell am I? What do I want? What kind of person do I really want to be? And as with us, this is when Gwen really begins to live her life.The author first gives us a glimpse of her love of Europe and travels there in the Acknowledgement, and, in the novel, you will see it seep from the pages. In her sweeping descriptions, you can almost feel the street beneath your feet, the wind on your face, the excitement of new discovery around every corner.And, as with all Marilyn Brant books, there's the other kind of love story too, this time in the form of a very hot Brit. But, in the end, Gwen's story is all about appreciation. Appreciation of herself, her sometimes crazy family, of others (both good and bad), but mostly appreciation for every moment of life we are given. And that's something we all need to remember, because it's like Marilyn's book says, 'It's not where you go. It's about what you take back with you.\""}, {"userName": "Jencey/", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1702941-jencey", "userReview": "Have you ever wanted to travel to Europe see the sights?

Summer in Europe takes the reader for an insightful ride, along with Gwendolyn Reese and the other members of her Aunt Bea's Sudoko and Mahjongg Club. For Gwen's thirtieth birthday her aunt has arranged for Gwen to go on the tour of Europe with her. At first Gwen does not really want to spend her time with a bunch of crazy senior citizens but after she thinks about it she decides, why not. She did not get the engagement ring from her boyfriend Richard and she does not want to upset her perfectly organized life to spend it traipsing around Europe. After she thinks about it she throws caution to the wind and decides to go after all. There are others from England who join the tour, as they will be participating in the Sudoko and Mahjongg competitions. In this group from England, Gwen meets two brothers, Thoreau and Emerson Edwards. Gwen and Emerson spend a lot of time together sightseeing. At first there is just friendship but slowly Gwen realizes what she has back home is not necessarily what she wants in life. This story takes the reader from Italy, to wandering the Louvre and climbing the Eiffel Tower, to more sightseeing in London. I loved the book for the story but also for the descriptions of all the stops made along the tour. The way the author described each made me feel like I was there. I could tell that the author was well versed in Sudoko and Mahjongg and Europe. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7739100-jackie", "userReview": "I think Marilyn Brant did a wonderful job of writing a story so complex with so many characters that I missed the beat of the book at first. And then I found it about 1/3 of the way through and what a wonderful beat that was.Gwen is a 30 year old woman who teaches mathematics to middle school children. She has her entire life all planned out and she has decided who she will marry. But none of this is based on the part of Gwen who knows the true desires of her heart. When Gwen's Aunt Bea invites her to go with her on a tour of Europe with her eccentric friends, Gwen is reluctant because she is uncomfortable around her Aunt Bea's friends. Just as Europe begins to take hold on Gwen so do the members of Aunt Bea's group. Gwen lost a loved one at an early age. Is this where Gwen lost an important part of herself or did it edge away slowly as she grew up, attended college, and met Richard? As Gwen slowly unravels the Gwen she thought she was into the Gwen she had always been she meets wonderful people who will change her life in dramatic ways.This is a wonderful book that is well-written and what I like to call a \"smart\" book in that it challenges me to really pay attention and learn something as I enjoy my choice. A Summer In Europe brings many characters together to deliver an entertaining, believable and complicated tale with an unexpected end."}, {"userName": "Elvenjen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4705993-elvenjen", "userReview": "My goodness, I could've either written this book or starred in this book. I relate SO MUCH to the main character, Gwyn. So many of her thoughts and actions (or inactions) are my thoughts and actions, her fears are my fears, you get the picture. It's fun to see a main character go through what you want to go through and have her inspire you. I especially loved the Thoreau and Emerson quotes, because they are two of my absolute favorite writers/philosophers.One of the most interesting parts of this book wasn't just the action but the amazing amount of information in this book. Not just European history and art, obviously a big part of a book about a European vacation, but also music, musicals, quantum physics, astronomy, chemistry, poetry, philosophy, math, Chess, gardening, and a host of other subjects. She packs SO much into this book, and she does it with mastery. So many writers would fail trying to discuss so much, and it would end up choppy and confusing, but this writing is very easy to understand and it flows so well!Truly an enjoyable book, one I'd easily read again, and I don't say that about a lot of books!"}, {"userName": "Melody McBride", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5159760-melody-mcbride", "userReview": "I've always wanted to travel around Europe and see the sights and feel the relaxed pace of life there. This book definitely increased that longing!I really enjoyed this book. I was able to relate to Gwen on a few levels, and I loved how she would say what she learned as she was there so we could learn along with her. I was happy to see how she grew throughout her travels, both because of what she was seeing and because of who she was seeing it all with. Emerson and Thoreau were definitely entertaining and fun characters, and believable in their depth.I don't normally stray from the YA genre, but this was a good book to read if I was going to stray. The only thing that made it just a little difficult to read was that some of the conversations between Gwen and Emerson were a bit too intellectual for me to completely understand. I guess it helps that Emerson's character was a physics professor, and I remember absolutely nothing from my physics class in high school...Anyway, this was a great read. I recommend it particularly to my friends who are travel lovers and lovers of a good romance. :)"}, {"userName": "Meg - A Bookish Affair", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132408-meg---a-bookish-affair", "userReview": "Oh this book is like sitting in the sun in the middle of a Roman piazza while eating a big scoop of gelato. It's lovely and something to be savored. Just about the only thing I didn't like about this book is that Gwen got to go to Europe for a month and I didn't. Yeah, I'm pretty jealous of this fictional character!This book had so many of the elements that I love. There's travel. There's a character who is transformed. Gwen's transformation is so well written. At first, she's not really exploring all of her options. She's happy with the status quo or so she thinks. Eventually she realizes that if she's willing to put herself out there and try new things that life can seem a little more full.The characters are fantastic. Gwen's Aunt Bea is a hoot. I loved all of the members of the S&M (which stands for Sudoku and Mah-jong in this case; thank you very much). I wasn't sure about Gwen at first. I wanted to urge her to not be afraid to live a little in the beginning but she really grew on me once she started changing a little bit.Sigh, this was so good; like a vacation in a book!"}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710785-katie", "userReview": "I feel kind of badly about not finishing this one, since I enjoyed the beginning of it. But then I put it down and just couldn't get back into and when I found myself skimming, decided it was time to give up.I could deal with the quirkiness of the aunt and her friends, but the love interest and his brother felt like too much. And there were lots details, but they didn't seem to MEAN much?And there's a touch of judgmentalness, which bugs me. (Her motivation for not liking the British women seemed to be they looked mean?)(Okay, yeah, I guess I made the right decision to give it up. Awesome premise, though. Judging from questions at the back of the book, I guess I was supposed think of A Room With a View? I'm planning to re-read that soon, as I remember enjoying it a lot. Anyway, I guess I can see similarities in terms of plot, although I'm not sure I would've thought of that on my own.)"}, {"userName": "Rrshively", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1377295-rrshively", "userReview": "At first blush this seems to be a typical chick lit book. However, it is too deep and profound to be merely chick lit. Whether gathering philosophies from physics to guide the living of life or getting lessons from mahjongg, math, or sudoku the heroine learns to be herself and to be open to adventure and change. Such ideas from physics as string theory and time/space relationships are explained in such a way that the reader can grasp enough to understand the author's point. The tour of Europe brings the reader along, and I enjoyed reading about a couple of places that I had visited. I may have never met people like most of the very unique characters except perhaps someone like Gwen, but I believe or would like to believe that similar quirky people truly exist. Of course there IS the 80-year-old former lounge singer with spiky red hair in my exercise class! By the way, some of the interesting unique characters are under 40."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17920620-holly", "userReview": "I was disappointed in this book. I really wanted to enjoy it. I was looking forward to living vicariously through Gwen (the main character) as she travelled through Europe (only my dream trip!!). However, I wasn't that lucky. Gwen was one of the most boring characters that I have ever had the displeasure of reading about. I wished I could have just reached into the book and slap her and say, \"Wake up and ENJOY this damn trip of a lifetime!!!!\" Besides Gwen being a complete bore, I felt there were too many characters thrown into the mix to keep straight. I thought when Emerson entered the picture he would bring more vitality to the story but whenever he talked it was either too much info about the statues/artwork they were looking at, or he would bring physics into the conversation. My mind just kept wandering off. I definitely had trouble getting through this book, which is too bad because Europe shouldn't be boring."}, {"userName": "Chanpreet", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5334800-chanpreet", "userReview": "I can tell you I enjoyed this book much more than Mariyln Brant's previous one, but not as much as According to Jane. Gwendolyn Reese turns 30, and instead of the engagement ring she's been expecting, her boyfriend of two years Richard, gives her pearl earrings to replace the ones her deceased mother had given her. A little unsettled and upset, Gwen accepts a surprise trip to Europe from her Aunt Bea. Not only is Aunt Bea going, but so is her wacky sudoku and mahjong group, also known as S&M. She meets lots of interesting people, especially two brothers from England, and starts actually enjoying herself and learning more about who she is and what she wants. The book was easy immerse myself in and the way the beautiful locales of Europe were described, kept me hooked. I was also very intrigued about the dynamic between the Edwards brothers and many of the other members of the S&M group.

The prospect isn't entirely appealing. But when the gift she is expecting--an engagement ring from her boyfriend--doesn't materialize, Gwen decides to go. At first, Gwen approaches the trip as if it's the math homework she assigns her students, diligently checking monuments off her must-see list. But amid the bougainvillea and stunning vistas of southern Italy, something changes. Gwen begins to live in the moment--skipping down stone staircases in Capri, running her fingers over a glacier in view of the Matterhorn, racing through the Louvre, and taste-testing pastries at a Marseilles cafe. Reveling in every new experience--especially her attraction to a charismatic British physics professor--Gwen discovers that the ancient wonders around her are nothing compared to the renaissance unfolding within. . .", "title": "A Summer In Europe", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11041204-a-summer-in-europe", "average": 3.5, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1321662626l/11041204.jpg", "reviews": 103, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2978367.Marilyn_Brant", "name": "Marilyn Brant"}], "type": ["Travel", "Womens Fiction", "Fiction", "Romance", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11041204-a-summer-in-europe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12389602-a-summer-in-europe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6594687-according-to-jane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11528113-on-any-given-sundae", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7794539-friday-mornings-at-nine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18241997-the-road-to-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17687981-pride-prejudice-and-the-perfect-match", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
