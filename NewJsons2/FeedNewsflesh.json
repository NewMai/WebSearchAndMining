There are some awesome action sequences, but no gratuitous feeding scenes, screaming teenagers, or B-horror movie cliches or gore. It's more of a novel about journalism, the right to information and free speech, and the personal and political ramifications of a wide-spreading disease. With occasional zombie action.This is also not necessarily a young adult novel. Not because it's inappropriate in any way, but because the themes it addresses are hard and sometimes the narrative is pretty dry. In the year 2039, Georgia and Shaun Mason, along with their friend Buffy (recognize any zombie-related names there?), are invited to cover Senator Ryman's presidential campaign in a world in which the Kellis-Amberlee virus has decimated the country's population and resources. Traditional news organizations have given way to the rise of internet journalism, and the trio of young bloggers must uncover a terrible conspiracy and disseminate information to their readers, all while risking their very lives.The strengths in this novel include incredibly well thought-out world-building, strong characters, snappy dialogue, unexpected plot twists, and excellent action sequences. Mira Grant's attention to detail in Feed regarding precautionary measures, sterilization procedures, and waiting for heart-pounding test results all rang very true. (Richard Preston's The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story scared the bejesus out of me when it was first published in 1999, and for awhile I was fascinated by the CDC and read a lot of books about various outbreaks and plagues.) Georgia, who is the primary narrator, is a butt-kicking heroine with a huge amount of integrity, and I loved her adopted brother Shaun, who sports both a cheerfully bantering demeanor and a crossbow. I have a healthy amount of respect for their efforts to survive and for their pursuit of truth, which often came at great cost to themselves and to those they hold dear.This is not to say that this is a perfect novel. There are overly long info-dumping passages (they are intelligently written and provide necessary back story, but they are info-dumps all the same) that would have been better served with more dialogue; a surprisingly uncomplicated, easy-to-spot villain; and some aspects of Georgia and Shaun's relationship that were teased but perhaps a bit unexplored. I wish there was also better build up of tension, a few more zombie encounters, less politics (a personal preference, though, since I find politics a big snoozefest), a less prolonged ending following a major game-changing event, and a little more emotion throughout the book. Overall, I think the spareness of prose and Georgia's all-business approach worked within the context of the story, but because I'm always looking for emotional connection, I would liked to have seen it spread out in more than just a couple of places. However...the scenes with emotional impact pack a gigantic wallop. It's hard to surprise me these days with unexpected story twists, but this one managed to do it not once, but twice--and the outcomes of both those revelations ratchet up the stakes in a way that nothing else could have. I had early, anxious worries about the ending, but things didn't unfold the way I expected--and it still didn't prepare me for the tears that flowed freely and the awful ache in my throat, both of which still come and go as I think about the book. That characters would still, in such extreme and tragic circumstances, behave with such integrity and nobility and selflessness and love, just wrenches my heart. To be honest, this would probably normally be a 4 star review because of points I mentioned. But because of its heartrending and unforgettable ending, it gets 4.5 stars from me. I think as readers, most of us go through dozens and dozens of books hoping to find that one book that shatters our expectations and leaves us speechless with unexpected feeling. For me, Feed is one that definitely does that.********************Here is my spoiler-free review of the sequel (which is okay to read even if you haven't read FEED). Reminder: DO NOT READ the synopsis for the second book in the trilogy, however, as it spoils major plot points for this first book."}, {"userName": "Flannery", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/652877-flannery", "userReview": "I think my Venn diagram says it all. What? It doesn't? Well, alright then. This book was a real roller coaster for me. I attempted to read a library copy in November and I just couldn't make it through. THE POLITICS. THE BLOGGING. There are several sections of Feed that really slow down the pacing. At points, I felt like I was running around an empty track. At others, someone had tied concrete blocks to my feet and I was running in quicksand. I am so happy that I finished it my second time through, though I have to admit that my motivation to do so was increased by 1) the fact that I was reading with a friend and 2) several of my Goodreads friends sing this book's praises.The ultimate strength of this novel is in the characters. Adopted brother and sister, Georgia and Shaun, hold the entire story together with their bond. I grew to really enjoy some of the side characters as well, though it was clear to me who was up to no good before their big reveals.I think the reason I didn't love this as much as some of my friends is that I felt it could've been at least 100 pages shorter than it was. (If not more) The beginning solidified Georgia and Shaun's familial situation and their friendship with Buffy, as well as the entire world they were living in and the blogging atmosphere. I was hooked. The ending was just fantastic. It was the middle that was rough going and it makes me nervous to start the second Newsflesh book--will it be a blog slog again?"}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6371997-lauren", "userReview": "This is not a zombie book, or at least not a zombie book in the way it is marketed. That's only part of the reason why this book pisses me off. It promises a zombie novel despite the fact literally hundreds of pages go by without seeing one. It kicks off with a bang and some zombie action and then that's it. When I buy a book on the understanding it's about zombies, I do actually expect to, you know, experience them. Mira Grant assumes otherwise. Two things that genuinely confused me; -- The pop culture references to the current world. Considering the fact this book is set 20 years in the future, in a completely different world and society and...people still remember Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Irwins are named after Steve Irwin, who, by the time all this takes place, is long dead. The whole George Romero thing irked me although I'm not really sure why. I understand his movies more or less catapulted zombies into mainstream culture but his most recent movies have flopped so hard people are wondering why he's still making them. I'm not ratting on the guy (Day Of The Dead was the movie that got me into zombies), I'm just saying I don't buy him having a god like status in society. -- The lack of anything sexual. Why? I'm not saying I expected it, or really that the book would have been better with some sex scenes but Grant avoided them to obviously, going as far as the categorically state both Georgia and Shaun are celibate with such abruptness my 'icky sex' radar went through the damn roof. It didn't help that she went to noticeable lengths to point out that they only needed each other, no one else under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I'm all for siblings being close but Grant failed massively and just made me suspicious some kind of relationship beyond brother/sister was going on. I was honestly expecting some kind of incest (they're adopted but have been brought up together. Not sure if that counts) subplot to come out and bite me. Georgia, for me, was a huge irritant. She was possibly an author insert and definitely a Mary Sue. She's awkward and hates the lime light yet gets lots of it, even though she tries her hardest to avoid any attention. She's the head of the team yet hates the recognition this gives her. She claims to deliver nothing but the truth, despite her blog posts being nothing but her opinion. She has an eye condition (another thing Grant doesn't let you forget) that means she's sensitive to light and can't go without her epic sunglasses. This takes nothing away from her appearance other than to make her look moody and cool. If my memory serves me right, someone even likens her to a rock star. On the occasions that she wears contact lenses, she wears bright blue colored ones so she can make people feel uncomfortable. Maybe Grant is under the illusion this is a flaw in some way (much like apparently being clumsy and falling over a lot is, ala Bella Swan) but it's obviously another way of showing how cool Georgia is. There was one passage when she even avoids a hug off of a well meaning woman who has been nothing other than kind to her because she didn't want to have to touch her/be touched. Hugs last about 3 seconds and she made it sound like touching this woman was akin to licking dog shit. What a rude dick. She cannot create good, believable characters. This is my biggest pet peeve. None of them (least of all Georgia and Shaun) can have a conversation without cracking juvenile one liners and generally showing how bad ass they are. And then there's the constant references to the blood testing kit. It was ok the first time, but 40th? Nope. I get it, it's a dangerous place to live (judging by the lack of zombie action, it's not really, but I'll pretend to go along with Mira anyway). I don't need to be constantly reminded every time they want to open a door. It's not like it's mentioned in detail the once, she go into detail every single time. The writing is repetitive to a point bordering on infuriating. If I had to read 'This is my brother Shaun, he pokes things with sticks!' one more time I probably would have burst a valve. She evens makes a reference to 'reaching for the stick' in the interview at the back. It wasn't funny the first time. Stop it. I really, genuinely do not like this book. The more I think about it the more it pisses me off. I'm sorry but I'm not buying any of it. Ps, the 'fictionals' made me want to smash my head off a wall. Wtf did she get that from? Pps, stereotyping and judging is not good, Mira. The only female politician is described as having big fake boobs, zero brain cells and no real talents other than squeezing her ta-ta's together. Whether or not that's Georgia with a case of The Bitchies I don't know, but it's not exactly fair and reeks of pathetic insecurity. The stereotyping? Oh dear. The only English character drops 'bloody hells' all over the place and has a blog called...'Fish & Clips'. I shit you not. Mira needs a holiday somewhere-outside-of-America.

Surprisingly, it\u2019s not about the Tea Party.In the year 2014, genetically engineered viruses mutated and caused the dead to come back to life and start munching on people like senior citizens at a casino buffet. Over 20% of the world\u2019s population got gobbled up like popcorn shrimp, and in 2040 the threat of the still existing virus and zombies has changed life forever. Since the virus is present in everyone\u2019s system, when anyone dies, whether it\u2019s from zombie bite or natural causes, they will turn into one of the undead cannibals. Large gatherings of people rarely occur, everyone\u2019s homes and cars are fortresses equipped with high tech screening equipment and huge areas (like Alaska) have been given up as zones too hazardous to enter without special permits and training.Georgia Mason and her brother Shaun are part of the new generation of bloggers. Georgia is a straight Newsie, reporting only the facts and trying to get past the spin. Shaun is kind of like one of the guys on Jackass who goes out to taunt the undead while recording and posting his exploits. When they are offered a chance to follow the presidential campaign of a senator it\u2019s a chance for them to move to the head of the pack of web journalists. However, when the senator\u2019s caravan is the victim of a zombie attack the Masons get caught up in a dangerous conspiracy.This was a pretty unique zombie tale with some very good ideas in it. The explanation for the way the virus works is one of the more thought out causes of the undead I\u2019ve read. It also shows a lot of thought of what the media of the future is going to look like with competing websites featuring a mix of news/opinion/death defying features and even fiction. Mira Grant has created a tale of how the fear of external threats can become an everyday part of society that\u2019s ripe for exploitation.However, at 600 pages it feels a bit overstuffed. We\u2019re repeatedly walked through the blood screenings and other security measures that are part of society to the point of boredom. Georgia has an eye condition due to the zombie virus present in her system, and there are about 1236 instances of security guys demanding that she take off her prescription sunglasses and the problems it causes. And for a book where the threat of zombies is ever present, there are very few actual zombie attacks in it.I couldn\u2019t quite wrap my head around the Mason\u2019s role in this story. They\u2019re supposed to be young journalists on their way up, but somehow Georgia\u2018s reports quickly become must reading on the web as she instantly became an expert on presidential politics her first time covering a campaign. Also, Georgia and Shaun are constantly looking down their noses at everyone around them for being \u2018amatuers\u2019 when it comes to dealing with zombies because (as we are repeatedly reminded) they are licensed and trained journalists with extensive time in the field. So these young people are apparently the only ones with the smarts, experience and ability to see what\u2019s going on and everyone, including a US senator, defers to them to an unbelievable degree.Still, this was fun mash-up of a zombie story and a political/ conspiracy thriller with some interesting predictions about where the new media will take us. I\u2019ll probably check out the next one in the series, but I hope there\u2019s more brain munching and fewer blood tests in the second book."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "three stars - look at me!! i am right in the middle of the road with this one!! watch out for traffic, karen!!!i wanted to read this as soon as it came out. i think i bought it the week we got it into the store. but, you know how i roll, this was just sitting around for ages and ages in a stack by the door. and then i heard that it was amaaaazing. and then i heard that it was terrrrrible. and etc etc. and it wasn't until zombie month 2011 that i managed to see for my damn self.and for me, it was good but i have no choice but to rate it in terms of the other zombie books i have read thus far. it was way better than dust and frail, but not as good as the reapers are the angels or raising stony mayhall. so we gotta go with a solid and respectable three. fair is fair, after all.i loved the characters in this book, i gotta say. george and shaun are both such damaged and driven people. and i was so relieved that grant didn't go where it looked like she wanted to go with their characters. she was toeing the line there for a while, and i was rolling my eyes and giving her warnings, but she never toppled over into 'ick' territory, and that made ME feel like the creep for seeing things that weren't there. i shake my fist at you, ms. grant, but appreciate that you made their relationship so exceptional without making it exceptionally gross.also great is the world building. it is dense with details and mostly reasonable; on the one hand the virus' transmission or \"activation\" is really cool. and not something i have seen before. so - nicely done there. on the other hand - does anyone remember the dandy warhols today, in 2011?? i don't think anyone in 2040 will be remembering them. there is nostalgia, and then there is just foolishness. but other than that, i enjoyed the details that were original and specific to this particular zombie world. that is always my favorite part of these kinds of books: what the author is contributing to the mythology that is unique to their story. the only reason i didn't like this as much as the two books that i really loved is because it is more of a traditional zombie story - an action story with political cover-ups and a central mystery and numerous action sequences. the books i found particularly great were more tricksy in the way they used the zombies. but that doesn't mean i am not going to read the second one. or the e-book short stories. i am curious to see where she takes the story, now that THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THIS BOOK HAVE HAPPENED. is my version of dancing around spoilers. all i know is that i liked this book, and even though i had to write some damn paper in the middle of it, which made my house look like this for a week or so:\n  (which looks totally cluttered, but is actually very carefully arranged.), i still was very interested in getting back to this book, and it was easy to fall back into its world when i needed a break from academia. i am going to read the second part later in the week, and then i guess wait patiently for the third part. as a bonus, here is a picture of my cat in a drawer. \n  man, i have lost the knack for writing book reports. i all dizzy from learning. who wants to read a paper about readers' advisory?"}, {"userName": "mark monday", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday", "userReview": "YO, THERE'S SOME MUTHAFUCKIN' SPOILERS UP IN THIS BITCH, FOR REAL\u2605 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 1 Star for the most grindingly obvious villain that i've had the displeasure of experiencing in years. he's a militaristic, right-wing, fundamentalist old man with the ruthless urge to dominate and no respect for youth, the media, liberals, etc. i know these people exist, obviously. but can't targets be picked with a bit more subtlety and finesse? this guy was out of central casting and only needed a moustache to twirl to be more obvious. geez louise, Captain Obvious: The Author... not only is the target predictable, but his every villainous move is telegraphed with thudding, insulting He Is Bad Man-ness. how trite. obvious, obvious, obvious. SNORE!\u2605 \u2605 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 2 Stars for some pretty shoddy writing at times. many times. no, i don't need to hear snarky comments made every other paragraph - because that's the way young adults on tv talk, not real young adults. at least not 100% of the time. and no, i don't need to read incensed reactions to hyper-vigilant security protocols every single time that a security protocol happens. good grief, enough is enough! repetition does not make this heart grow fonder. the second time this happened, i grimaced. the third time it happened, i began to hold a grudge. by the time it happened for the umpteenth time, yo, i was cursing up a muthafucking storm, for real. also, characterization for supporting characters: WEAK. i find out that Buffy was \"the funniest person\" that Shaun ever knew - and yet the reader has been given no evidence of this. in fact the reader has been given no evidence whatsoever that Buffy even has a personality beyond an OCD desire to be technologically on top of things. and at the end i find out that the nonentity known as \"Rick\" is now a vice-presidential candidate? uh, whatever. words can't convey my feelings of derision at that announcement.\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2606 \u2606 3 Stars for Overall Enjoyment. i, as the stars say, \"Liked It\". would i recommend it? no, probably not, except maybe to a teenager (although, duh, that's the target audience, mark, get a grip!). so despite the above complaints, and see below, overall this wasn't a disagreeable experience for me. the zombie attacks were sparse, and despite being a zombie lover, i appreciated their sparseness - it rather lifted this book above straight-up horror. and this is, i suppose, a bonafide YA novel... so i also really, really, really appreciated the lack of Corny Eyerolling Romance Lite. thank you, author! 3 Stars should be automatic for any novel that has intelligent goals behind its design, that seeks to entertain but also seeks to provoke and to make the reader both think and feel. 3 Stars for getting that right.\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2606 4 Stars for Edjumakation for the Youth. i am probably going to sound like an old man here (what's new), but the lessons in this novel actually are pretty important. and i think it is really important that The Young People, whoever they are, listen up. for real. the whole novel is an obvious parallel for what is happening in the States RIGHT NOW. or i guess what could be happening in the forseeable near-future. the U.S. is at a very dangerous crossroads as we speak, with religious fundamentalists and sociopathic assholes in political power (and often in collaboration with parts of the mainstream media), and poised to turn this country into Taliban Lite in terms of both domestic and foreign policy. yes, that's an exaggeration, but a purposeful one. now i love my conservative friends, so no offense to you all, but elements of the right-wing have degraded debate to a point where \"debate\" is simply a game of chicken. who can go the farthest? who can block the most policies? who can call who a communist or anti-american or [enter pathetic cliche here]. i think all the viciousness of the extreme right-wing quasi-fundamentalists is simply the viciousness of a group of close-minded, money-grubbin bullies who smell that the wind is blowing against them. but they are still in power! and they want to remain in power! and they have the resources to accomplish their disgusting dreams. so yeah, i appreciate all the points laid out so energetically in Feed. kids, teens, young adults, whatever... people should know what exactly is happening, and they should be pissed off and angry. the time for old men like myself is fading fast. and i'm not even that old - but me and my friends' main concerns these days seem to be more about day-to-day things involving work and family. and vacations. it was different when i was younger - i was angry! and broke, with very little in the way of tangible responsibilities. nowadays i just want to make sure i do the right thing on a daily basis - if i can say i've accomplished that, i've had a good day. so i really hope all the folks who are younger than me, all the folks who are inheriting this country and the earth... i hope that they are pissed off, angry, and that they want change. and for that, Feed is a 4 Star Call-to-Arms. well, not \"arms\" as in guns. you know what i mean. anyway, i really admire Feed's passion and its anger. i truly appreciate it.\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 5 Stars for that one chapter, and the one before it, and the one after. you know the ones i mean. She Dies. my God, that was moving. it was tough to read. i may have a ton of complaints about the writing overall, but in those three chapters, no complaints whatsoever. perfectly accomplished. i felt sick, i felt sad, i felt moved, i felt so much. beautiful job on that. incredible, really. i wouldn't change a word of Chapters 25, 26, and 27 because they all flirt with a kind of minor-note brilliance. just the kind that i like. wow! wow. so thank you for that, Mira Grant. a sad kind of thanks.~oh, and this was a Drunk Review. or at least a tipsy one. happy hour drinks after work with my pals, that's the way we old folks roll. now what's on tv? it's time to not-think. a perfect time for a zombie attack!"}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Looks like I'm going to have to add this book to the list I call 'Popular books I can't appreciate' along with novels like The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Magic Bites. To all those goodreads members who loved this book - I tried, I swear I did. I finished a book that failed to grab my interest one bit right up to the last page, I have never forced myself to read 571 pages of a book that felt like wading through sludge. Perhaps I am not intelligent enough for this story, but whatever the reason, I've come away with nothing but relief that it is now over.I won't give it 1 star, it is not a bad novel. The characters were varied and developed, the writing was sophisticated... but the story was just boring. Drab. Dull. I have mixed feelings about zombie novels; zombies themselves don't interest or scare me so there has to be something more to the story - this wasn't a problem. In fact, the book wasn't largely dedicated to flesh-eating and zombie moans, it was dedicated to something which I am very interested in and should have been what sold the book to me: politics.I am a self-confessed politics nerd, I have been for a long time - probably ever since I was eleven reading Orwell's 1984 and discovering for the first time how politics could be used to create one hell of a fictional story. I was delighted when I read that the novel was more political than anything else. Ah, well, it wasn't what I expected. In fact, this novel is one very long, drawn-out presidential campaign that made me want to tear my hair out with boredom. I am very surprised that I finished the book at all.I think I was waiting for a great pivotal change to occur about half way through - I've read several reviews saying that the pace picks up in the second half. I would say it does... marginally. I think other members obviously found a greater difference between the first and second halves that I didn't pick up on. It's difficult to say a novel is 'slow' to get going when I never really thought it did. Get going, that is.I found Feed to be a novel that was too long, too dull and too concerned with technical mumbo-jumbo. I'm not a genius but I'm no idiot either and I can't believe that I could be the only one thinking \"what on earth?\" at all the medical lingo and weird descriptions of things that I'd never heard of. I like books that can be educational as well as fictional but if I don't know what the author's talking about I can't take anything away from the experience. By about page 300 of this book, I would look at it on my desk and want to groan at the thought of picking it up again.

The world building, in terms of how folks deal with the zombies/viral outbreak is very good too. The author clearly knows her stuff when it comes to tech and virology. That aspect of the novel is very impressive.The Bad: In my opinion, the politics read too much like a white/middle class/suburban dream. The dueling candidates were broad brush stereotypes (including a head scratching--to be kind--choice to represent the only female politician in the book as a breast-enhanced bubble head) and the political generalities failed as satire (if that was indeed the intent), and they failed at insight. Politics plays a huge role in this novel, and for 2040 USA, I wanted more than good-guy/bad-guy politicians and social/cultural homogeneity.

I'll admit I have some prejudices that pushed me to that assessment:1) I really hate it when I can hear an author's opinions or point of view coming out of the mouths of his or her characters; Ian Malcom in Jurassic Park, Laszlo Kreizler in The Alienist, etc. Laszlo even *looks* like Caleb Carr. I know that authors almost always use their characters to channel some of the authors own thoughts and opinions, but when the writer uses the character as a direct mouthpiece it just looks amateurish and vain. Grant does this so blatantly that I feel I can comfortably assume she is a single, geeky, female who doesn't get along with her parents but still lives with them, drinks lots of Coke, has frequent migraines, loves cats, has given up on sex, and wishes she could wear sunglasses all the time without looking odd. No offense meant to geeks - I'm one too.2) I'd also assume that she writes and/or reads a lot of fanfic. That was the very first impression I had when I started reading this book and 500 pages later it hadn't changed. Again, no offense meant to those who enjoy reading or writing fanfic - if you like it, go for it - but I personally don't care for the stuff. It's almost always bush league (if that), written for a niche audience, and full of errors in style and editing. This book strikes me as the product of a fanfic writer who learned to structure a novel well enough to be published.3) Plenty of style and editing errors show through, though. It was bad enough that half way through the novel I started dog-earing pages so I could return to reference. The characters of Governor Tate and presidential candidate Ryman are so one-dimensional as to be completely unbelievable. She may as well have had Tate throttling kittens and Ryman running a baby dolphin rescue organization (hint: one of those examples is not my invention). I'm not racking my brain over it but I really can't think of an instance where I've encountered two flatter characters.4) She should fire Matt Branstad, \"who was responsible for verifying the accuracy of my firearms design...\" A lot of zombie fiction fans are also interested in survivalism and are gun enthusiasts, and when it came to weapon technology the details were only superficially touched upon. The computer technology details, on the other hand (which make up a large part of the book) seemed to be top notch, believable, and well researched. Of course I have no first-hand knowledge of that kind of stuff so I have no idea if it's accurate or not.5) Tons of lame self-aggrandizing statements like, \"He was a journalist after all and we're all incurably insane.\" *EYEROLL*6) She has a strange preoccupation with handshakes, describing three different characters as having handshakes that are strong but not too strong. (pg 81, 235, 399)7) She describes a VW Thing as having airbags which they were not built with. I suppose one could have been retrofitted but there's no mention of that detail. Furthermore, you can't be pinned by an airbag.Anyways I'm starting to sound like I'm piling on. Despite being a big fan of zombie stories I won't be picking up the sequels in this trilogy.eta: I'd logged around 400 books on Goodreads before creating the \"waste-of-paper\" shelf, just for this book."}, {"userName": "emma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma", "userReview": "Going to artsy college is weird.The school reading I\u2019m used to is, like, white dudes with sharp writing styles from the mid-twentieth century.

They were, for one hot, horrible summer at the beginning of the century, but now they\u2019re just another piece of the way things work. They did their part: They changed everything.\"\nIf you're looking for a simple zombie book, this ain't it. Filled with political intrigue, conspiracies, and a long, tedious political campaign -- amidst a zombie-filled post apocalypse world, of course -- Feed is intelligent, it's intense, and though some may find the first half a little long winded, it's completely worth it! A few things I learned once I started reading is 1) this is not a young adult novel; and 2) it's not about the zombies. The very first thing I noticed going into this book was the exquisiteness of the writing. The narration being notably mature and quick-witted makes it an exceptionally smart novel that is just a breath of fresh air. I felt intelligent just by reading Mira's words. This fantastic prose comes together with outstanding world building and amazing characters that become so real you can't help but get emotionally invested. Mira proves, via generous scientific details and infinite facts, that she has done her research through and through, bringing about a world filled with science and technology that turns this zombie apocalypse into a real threat with push beneath it, making it plausible and indefinitely scary. As it's a more technical and political novel especially during the first half, this \"info-dumping\" -- for lack of a better term -- could be a bit dry for some tastes; however, as someone who loves to absorb all this geeky information that essentially makes it one of the most realistic zombie novel I've ever read, I was kept thoroughly engaged in it from the start. Howbeit, I wasn't disappointed when we hit that half way mark and the shit hit the fan! Because once the ball starts rolling on this one, it rolls non-stop until we arrive at one of the the most shocking endings I've read, making me idolize Mira for this daring conclusion. Working a political campaign that turns deadly, the team of bloggers (aka news media) selected to travel with a candidate find themselves in the midst of it all. The leader of this group, Georgia, is our resourceful protagonist who can slap someone silly with her indestructible retorts, and shimmy her way into finding out any and all answers. She wants justice, and she's determined to get it! I loved every single thing about this girl. She has such vibrancy no matter if she's dealing with the campaign, her relationship with her adoptive brother, or writing her blog posts. Her voice oozes out this aptitude that makes her a warrior through and through. Her adoptive brother and best friend, Shaun, is also an incredible character who has the more silly, down to earth side of the coin that will make you chuckle, but he also shows his multi-layered personality through his blog postings from his perspective that we get at the end of several chapters. Working with this duo is a whole team of bloggers that -- even those we only glimpse at regularly -- all become strong players in this dangerous game. In the end, as the quote at the beginning states, it's not really about the zombies, it's a political thriller set in a post apocalyptic future where zombies run rampant. Still, the zombies do heighten the intensity of the plot, making is constantly exhilarating as you never ever feel safe. There are a million ways to die in a zombie novel, and this one is no exception.It's all just sort of unbelievably amazing. --For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Kimberley doruyter", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23952659-kimberley-doruyter", "userReview": "a zombie apocalypse so well written it could be real.still one of the best books i've read, when it comes to zombies."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8575414-emma", "userReview": "\u2018Corruption\u2019s been with us a lot longer than the living dead \u20184.5 stars.

I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong: this book has some fantastic, edge of your seat type action, including some of the zombie battling classics... I only have one bullet left! SAVE IT FOR YOURSELF! But the truth is, the zombies are merely the stimulus behind the really scary stuff in this book: human complacency and fear, the mass marketing of lies, and the biggest freak show of them all \u2013 the republican primary. Replace the zombies with water shortages, global warming, terrorism, or any of a host of other frightening topics and this world becomes chillingly close to our own.This story takes place in the not so distant future, where a mutated combination of a cancer cure and a common cold cure has spread to create hordes of the living dead. Disaffected by the mass media\u2019s early attempts to downplay and cover up the outbreak, many have turned to the bloggers to find the real truth. In this world, bloggers aren\u2019t just posting weepy break up poetry or ranting about the latest movie casting decision; they\u2019re carrying weapons, entering infected zones, and digging up the truth at all costs. Georgia is a \u201cNewsie\u201d \u2013 dedicated to finding and reporting the truth objectively. Her adopted brother Shaun is an \u201cIrwin\u201d (RIP Steve-o!) \u2013 always on the hunt for his next adrenaline ride through a zombie infested area. Buffy, the petite blonde fiction writer (\u201cFictional\u201d) and gadget whiz, rounds out the team. Georgia and Shaun have been raised under the bright lights of media scrutiny, as their celebrity parents search for their next ratings boost, and have developed a near symbiotic relationship as a result. When the team is called to follow the campaign of Senator Peter Ryman (who is like a cross between Bill Clinton and John McCain, before he became an embittered old coot), their ratings begin to soar\u2026especially when someone starts making attempts on the Senator\u2019s life.These days I tend to get extremely wearied by the state of journalism. Whenever I catch the news (typically only when I am forced to), it feels like so much fear mongering, propaganda spreading flatulence. I feel like the people that are reporting the real, unbiased stories are either a) working for small newspapers or b) working for independent outfits like ProPublica, and either way, no one is paying attention. This book made me excited about journalism again. I think that she found the perfect balance with George and Shaun, who walk the line between journalistic integrity and wolfish ratings boosting tactics. They bring to mind the best of the hero reporters, who may have been a bit devious, but always got the truth and gave it freely to the public.This book has elements of horror, hard sci-fi, political satire, conspiracy, and it even takes a quick turn into whodunit territory (I'll take Colonel Mustard in the gore soaked barn with a zombie pony...). It kept my brain fully engaged, my butt at the edge of my seat, and my heart completely invested in the characters (which is dangerous in such a fatal environment). Yes, I could see the deaths coming a mile away, but my heart still cracked with each one. I can tell that Mira Grant really did some research on virology. The one or two times that the overly logical part of my brain would have a little niggling doubt about some technical detail, the rest of my brain, heavily involved with the story, would tell it to just shut the hell up. I was well and truly hooked to this story, and boy, does she know how to build suspense! I swear, I practically gnawed off my own hand every time they took one of those virus detection tests.

Feed is that kind of book and even more.I loved how it started (with such a great adventure), and I loved that feeling I got through the story, like I was part of it, finding more and more information about the world, the virus, the people involved. Yes, at some point it got to be a bit slow, but it was still full of useful information and there was still way too much to enjoy so I never got bored.What did I expect?Ahh.. zombies?! Duh!I mean I am not a zombie fan, not at all, but this book was highly recommended to me so I said \"What the hell, I am reading it, and I'm sure I'm gonna love it!\"\n  What did I get?A lot more than that.Because this story is not really about zombies, you know? It's like saying that a book is about trees only because some scenes involve the main characters having fun in the park.. The trees are there, right, but the story is not really about them (ok, so maybe this is not such a good comparison because you don't see many trees trying to kill you in any story whatsoever, but you get my point).Same here.. There are zombies, and there is this virus transforming people into zombies when they die or get bitten/infected, but the story is more about these 3 characters - Georgia, Shaun, Buffy - and their blogging passion and their need to find the truth (all kind of truths).The 3 of them were friends, working together in a blog network, and they were so happy to get involved in the greatest adventure of their life, being selected in the position of \"pet bloggers\" for Senator Ryman's presidential campaign. What they never knew was how many dangers awaited for them.Georgia Mason - smart, and honest with herself and the world.She lived for the truth, she lived for the news, and she was pretty good at it. I like how she cared about her brother, Shaun, how she was always there to 'rescue' him when he was playing with the dead, and their adventures were awesome starting with the very first one.\"Our story opens where countless stories have ended in the last 26 years: with an idiot, in this case my brother Shaun, deciding it would be a good idea to go out and poke a zombie with a stick to see what happens\"Shaun Mason on the other hand was a bit childish, but he was also so damn cute, smart and caring, with a passion for danger and for 'poking zombies with a stick '. I loved his relation with his sister because they knew each other so well, and their conversations were refreshing and funny as they kept joking around even in the hardest of the times. Their close relationship was all they both had,\u00a0being\u00a0raised by their adoptive parents that only cared about ratings and numbers, it always have been them vs. the world.. but then the world really turned\u00a0against\u00a0them, didn't it?\n  This was by far the best duo I've read about in a while and they also made me want to cry (oh, don't you EVER make me cry again, do you hear me?!!!).There was this carousel of emotions (with the highs heavenly high and the lows so damn low) that left me feeling like I've been spinning around, and around, and around and.. I didn't see it coming, no I didn't.And you know how you feel when you stop spinning around? You feel lost and confused, you need something to hold on to, and the only thing I know I can hold on to is the sequel, and I need to read it, because I simply need to know what happens next.Buffy well, it's hard to talk about her\u00a0because she was mostly kept into the shadow. She was the one handling all the technological part - image, sound, servers, security - it was all Buffy's work. I understood when she needed someone next to her, and I cared for her when she was afraid, but I wish I could have known her better. I\u00a0don't\u00a0want to spoil her relationship with the other 2 and her role into the story, so I'll leave it at this: she did surprise me.. a lot.\"She listened to all kinds of music, even the stuff that sounds like static and church bells. She played guitar really badly, but she meant every note.\"Now, the part that I didn't like that much, was the one involving politics.. that part was so hard to get through. Of course, it was there to deliver more information about the settling, about the world, about how things worked.. not to mention that it was crucial into the story, with the 3 bloggers following the senator in his campaign, but at some point there was just too much settling and too little action and\u00a0it made me yawn a bit and I put the book down a few times.There would be some more things I loved or hated, but no, I can't talk about them because they are all spoilers. But I loved the characters, the story, the writing is great too, so if you want to try it I don't think you could possibly be disappointed. Really, you'll like it (even love it) :)\n  ... Oh, I've almost forgot to tell you how much I HATE needles. Oh yes I do!

After reading it, I agree it deserves its reputation. Look at the synopsis, and you may think: zombie. In reality its a book where the zombies hover in the background of a character-rich mystery. I forgot about the zombies half the time, because it's not a horror book about zombies; it's a drama/thriller with zombies in the world.Not violent, you don't get many descriptions of the walking dead or graphic death scenes. A lot of it is heard about after the fact when relayed to the reader, and most of the deaths aren't actually zombie based, but zombie-virus tainted. If you're a gore reader picking this up expecting plenty of the red stuff and unrelenting terror, you won't be satisfied with those elements. If you're looking for a steadily paced and intriguing story, you'll be content.The story is about a brother and sister following a political candidate who is set to become the new President, but they have to fight assassins and political trickery along the way. The culprit wasn't a surprise unfortunately, but there was a betrayal I didn't see coming, and a totally surprising death. Grant didn't hold the punches with the tragedy, and her writing style made the story flow smoothly.It's not a perfect book - there are some slightly lagging parts and minor bugs, but just the enjoyment level alone was good enough for the five star rating. The book would have worked even better a little trimmed and sped up, but I still sunk into the character's mind as she pondered the fate of the world and chased truth across country. Adding in the weird background of her parents and their media frenzy gave a genuine feel to the backstory of the media influencing this world. The book is broken into editorials and pieces from the news cast; I skimmed a couple of them, but a few made me think.Zombie-lite but intriguing story."}, {"userName": "Justine", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18656418-justine", "userReview": "4.5 stars I actually like zombie books and so I've read quite a few. This one definitely rates up there among the top, achieving the goal of situating an interesting story in a post-zombie apocalypse world.The result in this case is a sort of genre mash-up of zombie survival with political thriller, and it works wonderfully. Grant has a wordy storytelling style, which I first noticed when I read Parasite, but I think she makes it work with the narrative. In both cases the verbosity seems consistent with the characters, particularly here, where the main character is a news blogger. The only reason it took me so long to read it was that I listened to Feed as an audiobook. Even though it was very long, I never tired of it; both narrators did a great job. The last 20% of the book in particular is edge-of-your-seat listening.One thing I particularly liked about this book was the relationship between siblings Georgia and Shaun Mason.

I am a huge fan of zombies\u2026 and I always thought that everyone else was too, but from reading reviews of this a main reason why people were unsure about this was because of the zombies. Zombies were the reason why I picked up these books. More than zombies- even though I am all for zombies, they only have a cameo appearance in this story. It is about so much more and it\u2019s a shame that this book is being described as a \u2018zombie book\u2019 because there is like a million other things that go on as well. Great depiction of siblings\u2026 very realistic but also hilarious and poignant *sob*. The setting- so much thought has gone into this and the back story is amazing. Also\u2026 LOVE the fact that variations of George (Romero) are the popular names of the time because that would actually happen. News and journalism- what a fascinating speculation of the future of the news and the rise of the importance blogs\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure Ms Grant saw into the future with that one. Hopefully not about the evil Rising and gnashing zombies though\u2026TENSION. Man, this book was tense I practically have no nails left. Red light green light red light green light red\u2026 ARGH. Subtle but effective writing that feeds (sorry\u2026 couldn\u2019t think of a better word) little clue snippets into the dialogue so you\u2019re left guessing write up until the end. And speaking of the end\u2026in the great words of Bony M\u2026. oh ma looooord. This book was totally not what I was expecting and it always left me guessing. I don\u2019t mean to sound big headed, but I quite often predict what is going to happen in things\u2026not because they are necessarily flimsy plots, but because I\u2019ve watched a lot of television and read a lot of books. So even though I had some pretty major quibbles with this book, I loved this book so much, not only for having an interesting story, exploring fascinating concepts and ideas but for proving that actually, Jo\u2026 you\u2019re not as smart as you think. Because damn, I did NOT expect this book to go the way it did. Flabbergasted. Low points. This book really started off sooooo slow and it took quite a while for things to happen. There was also a lot of politics and even though it was interesting to get the back story and why what was happening was happening, I found it to be unnecessarily in depth and it became quite repetitive. I understand that it was important for the reader to get understand the big ideas (especially when you read Deadline, the second book of the trilogy)\u2026 but it did become a bit tedious. The blogging/technical side of things. Gosh there was a lot of technical jargon in this book (which is probably a high point for a lot of people, but I am a geek but not a computer geek) and a lot of it went over my head. This is probably my fault for my eyes glazing over whenever big bro tried to explain computer things to me\u2026 but about 60% of this was lost on my poor English Literature/Film Studying brain. I loved Georgia as a character- she is intelligent, resourceful, dedicated to her profession and the search for truth and she\u2019s caring but she\u2019s not a simpering girly girl, which was great because I don\u2019t think I could have handled romangst in this book. BUT\u2026 I really didn\u2019t like her as a narrator. I like to connect with my narrators and I\u2019m not saying George was heartless or anything, but\u2026 I think the only thing I had in common with her is how I take my caffeine: Cold. Heroine/Hero/ Best friend. I briefly mentioned George in the low points section\u2026 so I won\u2019t go on too much about her. I\u2019ll focus on my positive feelings towards her. I thought she was such an original character\u2026 a girl who runs a blog documenting the world post- zombie rising, who surpasses all the boys with her mad computer skills and can kill zombies? YES PLEASE. And also, she\u2019s a writer looking for the truth. Aren\u2019t we all, George? Aren\u2019t we all? What I loved about her was that even though George is a complete tom boy and perhaps the furthest away from loving material things as you can get (except for the hair dye, of course!)\u2026 she wasn\u2019t really aggressive with it. She is different than all the other girls but she accepts this and just gets on with it and gets on with her job. I\u2019m so glad that Grant wasn\u2019t like \u2018LOOK HOW ORIGINAL THIS TOMBOY CHARACTER WHO DOESN\u2019T LIKE FASHIONABLE CLOTHES AND DOESN\u2019T UNDERSTAND BOYS IS\u2019 all the time, because in a lot of dystopian novels (*cough* Mockingjay *cough*) this happens and it\u2019s so off-putting and amazing characters (*cough* Mockingjay *cough*) are ruined by this.Even though I didn\u2019t have much in common with George and didn\u2019t relate to her as much as I have narrators in other books I\u2019ve read\u2026 I appreciated that it was her telling the story because in hindsight (which, of course, is 20:20) I don\u2019t think this book would have worked if it hadn\u2019t been told from how she saw it from behind her aviators. Which leads me nicely to Shaun (and yes, I immediately thought of this and this) but no offense to Simon Pegg, who does have some kind of nerdy British charm and an understandable fondness for Cornettos\u2026 this Shaun was muuuuuuch cuter and yes, I have a crush on him. He is George\u2019s brother, co-worker and best friend. But unlike George, he's kinda glad there are zombies everywhere because his job is to go into the field and report on the zombies from up-close. And, of course, poke them with sticks. Shaun is such a great character: he\u2019s hilarious, he\u2019s stupid, he\u2019s a typical boy, he's dangerous, he walks around in his underwear (BOOM.), he\u2019s reckless but he has such a good heart and he's so honorable and just a massive cutie in cargo pants. I also love the relationship between George and Shaun, it\u2019s such an interesting dynamic because normally with sibling relationships in books it seems so forced and \u2018Ohh my brother/sister is soo annoying\u2019. But G & S really care for each other, they rib each other but they seem to slot perfectly together, their relationship was my favourite part of this book. Sigh. Baddie.Ignoring the fact that the flesh-eating zombies are kinda baddies\u2026 I was a little disappointed with the main, main baddie. I like my evil characters with a bit of mystery and intrigue but this one seemed to just stroll up on the page and be like \u2018HI JO, I\u2019M EVIL AND I\u2019M GOING TO CAUSE PROBLEMS. MUHAHAHA\u2019 as he twiddled his moustache. BUT BUT\u2026 I\u2019m writing this book after I read Deadline and like I said about hindsight being great, even though the baddie in Feed wasn't the best\u2026Grant did an amazing job at setting up the baddies for book numero deux. The bigger picture \u2018n\u2019 all. Theme Tune.They Are Night Zombies!- Sufjan Stevens.I was going to choose a very literal song for this book\u2026 but I decided against it when I found this gem by Sufjan Stevens. When I first saw the title, I was expecting it to be a funny song and then was surprised at the sense of melancholy, the lack of permanence and the poignancy that it evoked. Like how I felt with this book, when my preconceptions were challenged. The song is all about the resurrection and how the mistakes of the past can shape the future which makes it particularly relevant to the message of the book. Also\u2026 it has possibly the best title ever. (The full title is \u201cThey are Night Zombies! They are Neighbours! They Have Come Back from the Dead! Aaaah\u201d)Angst Level.10/10. GOD. This book. I finished this book a few days ago but I literally couldn\u2019t bring myself to write about it because the ending shocked me and affected me so much. I keep thinking about it and nearly drown in the emotion that it brings. There are a lot of deaths in this book, some are pretty obvious and easily to predict, but they are dealt with such raw emotion that even though you may have guessed it was coming, you still feel your heart ripped out and mourn with the characters.Recommended For.People who think zombies are better than unicorns. People who like adventure books. People who like dystopian books that have a bit more \u2018ooomph\u2019 to them. People who don\u2019t mind their stories lacking in romance. People who like strong, original and unflappable female narrators. People who are interested in journalism and the way news is presented. People who like conspiracies. People who are scientifically inclined. People who saw 28 Days Later and thought \u201cI want to go to there\u201d. People who believe in exposing the truth, no matter what. People who have a brother/sister. People who would quite happily tolerate their boyfriend poking rabid dead people with sticks because he\u2019s super cute. People who have nerves of steel. People who have no tear ducts and/or emotions."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "Feed fractured my heart, and then broke it - so, of course, it deserves to be my first five-star book of 2012. It is definitely not your typical zombie story with sleazy action sequences and creepy cliches, but a wonderful mix of zombies, blogging, and politics.The book takes place after the Rising of 2014, in which the cure to the common cold and the cure to cancer combined to form a virus that raised the dead. Several people were immediately infected and many more lost their lives during that initial outbreak. Now, twenty years later, Georgia and Shaun Mason are internet journalists devoted to seeking the truth at whatever the cost. When they are selected to follow the campaign of popular presidential candidate Peter Ryman, they may have their chance to do so as a twisted conspiracy threatens to take them under.If not for school, I would have finished this book in a day. Feed has everything: strong world-building, convincing characters, shocking scandal, and a wild story that will hook you in and never let you go. I connected with the characters well, and the fact that I cried for half an hour after reading the ending serves as evidence as to how much the book affected me.I am so glad I gave this book to one of my best friends as a Christmas present - she and I talk about zombies constantly now. We plan to become professional zombie slayers, though I doubt I would have the willpower to pull off such a feat. Anyway, if that random tangent hasn't assured you of the awesomeness of this book, you must go out and get it now!*cross-posted from my blog, the quiet voice."}, {"userName": "N.K.

In Grant\u2019s world, every human being is infected with the virus that causes zombiefication upon death, so the threat of a new outbreak is constant \u2014 every time someone has a heart attack or a bad car accident, their bodies have to be dealt with very quickly, or else. Sometimes they spontaneously \u201camplify\u201d even before death, in response to stress or an injury, just like with any other virus. Grant\u2019s done her science research on this one \u2014 epidemiology, sociology \u2014 but at its core, this is a story about the news. Yeah, the news. See, in this world, during the zombie apocalypse, the mainstream media proved it couldn\u2019t be trusted. Reports from the major networks downplayed the severity of the problem, ridiculed evidence of flesh-eating monsters, and so forth \u2014 so the only safe, accurate information came from bloggers, who risked their lives to help the world survive. Years later, bloggers are the mainstream media, yet they retain their own quirky, quintessentially independent culture. The story follows intrepid newsie Georgia and her brother Shaun as they get the scoop of a lifetime: a chance to follow the presidential campaign of a young up-and-coming senator. The senator\u2019s not that interesting, frankly, but the fact that someone\u2019s trying to assassinate him with zombies is. So Georgia and her team must literally risk life and unlife to uncover the source of the threat.This is a thriller wearing skiffy clothing. The fact that it takes place during the zombie apocalypse is irrelevant; it could be taking place during an outbreak of weaponized ebola. (Except ebola victims don\u2019t try to eat you.) I count it as science fiction, though, because Grant deals realistically with the evolution of society; the worldbuilding here is fascinating in and of itself. And the characters kept me hooked all the way through, particularly as Grant pulls no punches in showing just how ugly a conspiracy in high places can get. There are some obvious digs at Bush-era politics and the information privacy wars, and some interesting namechecks of current media figures (e.g. Irwins). Bottom line: I can\u2019t wait for the next book."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "I kept passing this book by partly because I am not a fan of zombie books and partly because that title is horrible. Well it turns out all I was doing was missing out on a really good book! Yes there are zombies in it but really they are just the back story. The main event revolves around Georgia and Shaun Mason, their relationship and the way they live their lives in a dystopian future where scientists have eradicated cancer and cured the common cold but have unwittingly released a killer virus on the whole world. The scientific parts are obviously fiction but they are convincingly written. The characters are also well written and I find I am still thinking of them after the book is finished which is always a sign of a good book.

Not only did the author further developed the diversity of the novel, but it made me stop and think if the death was necessary in the first place. Georgia and Shaun were both really iconic, so one death might trigger a revolution. I found her death relevant yet sorrowful. I didn't really expect to feel much for a character's death in this novel, but I realized how much I've learned to love some of them. Buffy's another story. Her death triggered Georgia's dark side.

It\u2019s like I\u2019m working twenty-four seven in the outside world without knowing that I\u2019m lying on my bed without doing something, idle for hours and it\u2019s becoming my favourite habit. Well, Feed, Feed is another issue. I read slowly; the book\u2019s pacing was slow; exhausted from a week long travel. In the end, I finished the book for two weeks. Two weeks full of shit like those scared people influenced under the fear of becoming one of the undead. And I\u2019m sure if the Rising is real, I could be like one of them. I mean them, those people who hid from the darkness of fear.Feed, written by Seanan McGuire under her pen name Mira Grant, is the first instalment of Newsflesh Trilogy and published widely by Orbit Books. The novel tells the story of a group of young bloggers, accepted to document a political official in his quest to enter White House. The book was narrated by one of the Mason\u2019s siblings, Georgia Mason, a Newsie and an Alpha blogger. As the story goes deeply into the mind of Georgia, conspiracies become visible that driven the American political world into a nightmare of the mankind. Zombies are popping around the streets, friends are traitors, enemies are hiding and most of all, there are secrets that are meant to share. Did Georgia and Shaun survive in the war between the good and the evil? It\u2019s a matter of faith and let Georgia finish her story.Feed is one of my most challenging books to read. It has something to do with politics which my brain cannot constantly digest every word Senators and Governors are talking about. All I could read are praises that soon to be mischiefs of men inside and outside the book. Maybe this is how politics works in reality; they are the sophist; they have the tongue of snakes; they can visibly seduce anyone; they can hide their true skin. This book could be condemned by the government if they wanted it so if zombies were real or maybe if you are living in a country where politics is a very sensitive issue. Fortunately, the whole zombie bonanza and bullet proof vests were another illusion made by Mira Grant that could be possibly real in the near future.Another problem I encountered was the long chapters, the never ending sentences, the infinite words and I called these chapters as Georgia\u2019s very observant mind. I don\u2019t mind reading long chapters if they really not meant to drag you out of your seats. This is another issue, it didn\u2019t drag me out of my seat but it dragged me out of my body. Is this worst or what? Just guess. Some part bored me to death that I never dared to continue reading it back again and start another chapter the other day. I don\u2019t like to spoil myself from too many conspiracies that every end of the chapter only gave me very powerful last words but no answers. Well, that\u2019s a positive part of the book. The words were too bold that the book clearly speaks of Mira Grant's message. Truth must prevail and what Georgia did is a suicide but for the braves, it\u2019s heroism.The first thing that I enjoyed about Mira Grant is the constant giving of punch lines. Yeah, I really mark what I said. It really punches you to the face and I saw another bullseye coming. It speaks of the truth and Georgia is the medium of that truth. If only they gave me time to cover my face, then I should. It\u2019s the awkward moment when you as an outsider to America\u2019s territory can relate to the political situation of the book. It\u2019s a universal rule, politics is the dirtiest job. Who could tell not? So if I were you, you should hide under the roof of your houses and let the brave ones fight for our rights. Wrong. We, I mean we as the victims of lies, must work to change the dirtiest job in the universe. But the one we choose can prevent himself from the pestering seduction of power? That\u2019s another problem.The division of bloggers in the book is quiet unique. I know the so called \u2018division\u2019 are quiet popular lately. For example, in The Hunger Games Trilogy, Suzanne Collins divided the population into fourteen (consider the capitol and the thirteen) districts, each may possess a special skills and product. Another example can be found in Veronica Roth\u2019s bestselling book Divergent. She divided the people into four groups which encompass their skills and futures. And Feed, divided bloggers into many categories. One can be a Newsies, Stewarts, Irwins, Aunties and the Fictionals. The difference is, this divisions are way geeky than the others which can be loved by the literary part of the society. And I mean it this must be loved!The blogging community divided into its current brunches within a few years of the Rising, reacting to swelling ranks and changing society. You\u2019ve got Newsies, who report fact as untainted by opinion as we can manage, and our cousins, the Stewarts, who report opinion informed by facts. The Irwins go out and harass danger to give the relatively housebound general populace a little thrill, while their most sedate counterparts, the Aunties, share stories of their lives, recipes, and other snippets to keep people happy and relaxed. And, of course, the Fictionals, who fill the online world with poetry, stories and fantasy. They have a thousand branches, all with their own names and customs, none of them meaning a damn thing to anyone who isn\u2019t a Fictional. We\u2019re the all-purpose opiate of the new millennium: We report the news, we make the news, and we give you a way to escape when the news becomes too much to handle.Read above and who could dare not to love this book as much as I did. This is the new generation of bloggers that soon to be part of the zombie-apocalypse and the text above is taken from one of Georgia Mason's blog posts. I hope everyone is safe inside their home and for the extra courage, an oath is shared.An oath for everyone;Georgia Mason is the daughter of the American Revolution.She took the right road.The truth prevails.We must fight for our rights.And believe me, this book could be the start of something new.I\u2019m Sweet Reads and I\u2019m signing off.Those who died, you\u2019ll be missed.Rating: Feed by Mira Grant, 3\u00bd SweetsReading Buddies: Tina, Aaron, Blue, Beejay, Charles Tan, Ace, TriciaEavesdropper: Isa & MariaChallenges:Book #76 for 2011"}], "description": "Feed", "title": "Feed\n      \n          (Newsflesh #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10813144-feed", "average": 3.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386011237l/10813144.jpg", "reviews": 5522, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3153776.Mira_Grant", "name": "Mira Grant"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror", "Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10813144-feed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7094569-feed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8146541-feed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7199486-feed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13527860-feed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8114678-feed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8429687-deadline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11806716-blackout", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13641105-parasite", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11509894-countdown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13641108-symbiont", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
