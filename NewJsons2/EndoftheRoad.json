While the stories themselves are well written and entertaining, the value I took away was like window shopping for authors. But I would better to describe it as a 'wine tasting': a tantalizing sampling of style and prose from some gifted artisans.  This themed anthology has the common thread from the title, but what's interesting is the many journeys that lead to the same destination.The End of the Road could mean so many different things from the end of a life, relationship or career. Chances are, if you can think of the end of anything you'll find it here. From smooth, elegant and flowing to as rough and gritty as the desert sand, you're sure to find a flavor you like.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "C.A.

There is a tremendous spirit of cooperation, friendly competition, and even love behind this book, and it shows in the quality of the writing.The anthology spans a wide variety of genres, from ghost stories to sci-fi to adventure and romance. \"Joint Venture\" by L.S. Burton rivals classic Bradbury stories. Russell Blake's \"Clay\" reminds me of a tough John Steinbeck. Other favorites include \"The Last Hours of Brandon Kratz\" by James Rozoff\" (who doesn't enjoy a good serial killer?) and \"Sans Cinderella,\" a quirky fairy tale by Traci Hilton. \"The Frozen Truth\" by Shirley Bourget takes an unexpected turn. This is a terrific collection and I'm honored to be a part of it."}, {"userName": "Donna McNicol", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8737884-donna-mcnicol", "userReview": "A diverse range of stories from multiple genres.

Having marked it as read, I felt compelled to leave a rating rather than leaving it blank and possibly giving it 0 stars. Having said that, I am honored to have my name next to those of some truly talented writers. Even the stories outside of my comfort zone were pleasant surprises, managing to put intelligent twists on genres I thought had little to say to me.

They begin somewhere, too. In between, all manner of things happen: friendship, betrayal, horror and maybe even joy. For some, the End of the Road brings love and happiness, for others agony and suffering, and for a precious few, sorrow may lead to something revelatory. The potholes and pitfalls found in this anthology are many, but for every character, there is an end of the road. This road ends in a collection of short stories by 31 of the most gifted writers of our time, with stories from action and mystery superstars Russell Blake, Traci Tyne Hilton and Mike Meyer; romance stars Jeannette Raleigh, C A Newsome, Suzie O'Connell, Kathleen Steed and Anna J.McIntyre; and from cutting edge science fiction and fantasy authors Saxon Andrew, Stephen Arseneault, John Daulton, and JRC Salter; post-apocalyptic and dystopian authors Brandon Hale, Scott Langrel, Dale Roberts and Jess Mountifield.
