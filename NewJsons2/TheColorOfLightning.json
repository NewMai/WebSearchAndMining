The setting once again is late 1800s Texas and Captain Kidd makes an early appearance reading his newspapers, reporting the passing of the Fifteenth Amendment allowing the vote to all men regardless of race or color. In his audience is former Kentucky slave Britt Johnson. In her ending notes the author says that though this is fiction its \u201cbackbone\u2014Britt\u2019s story\u2014is true\u201d and what a great story it is to one like me who loves this subject matter.Britt returns home to find friends as well his oldest son slaughtered by plains Indians and wife Mary and their two other children taken. He sets out alone on a quest to rescue them.Samuel Hammond, a peaceable Quaker, has just arrived as new agent for the Office of Indian Affairs which is rife with corruption. He is a decent man and feels called to help the suffering tribes but is disturbed to learn that warriors have been going off reservation raiding, killing, and taking captives.The narrative of Mary, her friend Elizabeth, and the children\u2019s time in captivity with the Kiowa is very powerful and brutal reading, setting the reader down into the very heart of the clash between two cultures, one of which is passing into history but whose unfettered lifestyle is very enticing to the children despite the horrors they have witnessed. Life on the wide open plains also beckons to Britt, where there is freedom from the white man\u2019s prejudice and a man can live on his own terms.Once again Paulette Jiles has thoroughly engaged me with her lyrical prose and fascinating characters as she opens up a window into our conflicted and violent history."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20625013-liz", "userReview": "This book is by turns vivid, beautiful, violent, and brutal. It is not a quick read and it\u2019s not for the faint of heart. Just as in News of the World, Paulette Jiles has her very own unique style and while it might not work for everyone, it resounds with me. She doesn\u2019t just paint a picture, she uses words to create a new dimension, an atmosphere, a whole world. I feel like some of her passages could be considered poetry, in some sense.\n  One early morning there was a heavy fog. They broke camp in a strange isolate stillness as if in a world just formed and not yet emerged into definition. Every limb adorned with lines of tiny drops and the grass wet. They walked on with soaked, dark legs, and they covered many miles in silence, going nowhere in the same spot with the blurring fog all around them.\nAfter the Civil war, American settlers encroaching upon the territory of native tribes resulted in a very bloody period of conflict which lasted for many years before its sad conclusion. Jiles gives thoughtful consideration to both sides of this quarrel in which plains settlers in northern Texas are living in fear of Comanche and Kiowa raids, while the natives are simply trying to maintain their freedom and way of life in the only way they know how. The period and setting impacts all of the characters, most of whom are based on real people. Children forever altered by tribal captivity. Women enduring atrocities and becoming stronger than many men through sheer will to survive. Peaceful, non-violent men hardened by war, who eventually will relinquish their tightly held ideals. \n  He felt he was turning into someone else. Or perhaps someone he had always been. He was hardening like pottery fired in a kiln. Hard angry words in his head carrying an abrasive silt. He did not like the sounds of the words in his own head. \nI think this book requires patience and attention and if you have that, it will be very worth it to you. I didn\u2019t tear through it, I savored it page by page, and in the end I felt drained but complete."}, {"userName": "Toni Reese", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3036181-toni-reese", "userReview": "I don't often go back and reread a sentence just because it is so beautiful, but I found myself doing just that while reading THE COLOR OF LIGHTNING.

A man is standing in dense fog, trying to be totally silent, because he knows that a Kiowa or Comanche is nearby, as he heard the voice singing and chanting a song of grief. The man may not be able to see anything because of the fog, but sounds are magnified.

The historical period and themes are similar, but the focus is more on two characters. This novel is much wider in scope, with more storylines. The violence was quite a bit more explicit, and if this hadn't been for a postal book swap, I may have quit after the first chapter. Phew! To me, the most interesting story was that of Samuel, the Quaker being sent to the lawless front where the Comanche are killing and kidnapping while the settlers attempt to work land that doesn't really belong to them. What a complex and dangerous situation to send a man into, especially when the expectation is that he was only use his words and not violence to navigate the situation! I appreciate the nuances the author was able to show about his impossible task.The idea of captives missing their lives in captivity continues to intrigue me, and I love this:\"She was afraid of the slow death of confinement. Of being trapped inside immovable houses and stiff clothing. Of the sky shuttered away from her sight, herself hidden from the operatic excitement of the constant wind and the high spirits that came when they struck out like cheerful vagabonds across the wide earth with all of life in front of them and unfolding and perpetually new. And now herself shut in a wooden cave. She could not go out at dawn alone and sing, she would not be seen and known by the rising sun.\" (pg. 222) This is what I love about book swaps.

Based on a true story, this novel is also graphic and bloody (take note: not for the queasy) in its descriptions of the capture and dispatching of frontierspeople by Kiowa and Comanche. One of the things I loved about the story was its realism. The violence was completely necessary, in my opinion, to fully understanding the story and the relationships of the characters. The author was fully adept in describing the problematic relationship of the Native Americans of the Plains and the settlers. Each committed atrocities, each came from different worlds, clashes were inevitable. All of the characters were interesting: Britt Johnson, ex-slave from Kentucky; his wife Mary; his son, who is coming of age when he is captured; Samuel, sent from the most nonviolent sect (Quaker) to be agent to two of the most violent, nomadic tribes settlers would ever clash with....

This one is set in North Texas--right in my back yard. It is the fictionalized version of, Britt Johnson, a freed slave's life immediately following the Civil War. His wife and children were kidnapped by Kiowa Indians and he rescued them single handedly. There are many points of view represented in the novel including a Quaker Indian agent--very loosely based on Laurie Tatum, and the Comanches and Kiowas who were fighting for their fading way of life. The fact that I taught Texas History for 7 years might be one of the reasons I was so riveted by this book. I recognized so many of the characters and the places. The research that must have gone into the book is mind boggling. Jiles did a fantastic job and should be commended. Furthermore, this book is a testament to the the power of the library!

The Black man/Indian perspective was also intriguing.This is the story of Britt Johnson, a true-life black man, and the story of his life just after the Civil War. Britt was a freedman with a wife and 3 three children. Not much is known of him in hard facts, though his story has lived on in oral tradition throughout the ages. When he was off with the other men of his homestead area getting supplies in town, the Comanche and Kiowa came in a raided their homesteads. Killing, raping and taking captives. Britt's wife was raped and suffered a major head wound, his eldest son was killed, while his wife and two younger children were taken captive along with a neighbouring white woman and her two little granddaughters. We see this story from Britt's side, from Mary's side, from the children's side, and from various Indian character's sides as well. There is also introduced a Quaker man who becomes the agent of Indian Affairs for these two violent Native groups and he wrestles strongly with his peaceful Quaker ways and the violent kidnapping of children & women by the Indians as he becomes the only man with enough power to help those being violated but he must go against his religious philosophies to do so and yet his moral self will not allow him to not help stop the atrocities.A fine book that brings deep perspective to a dark period of American history. Indians are being sent off their land and made to live on reservations to learn to farm when it is not their way, but in return their way is raiding and war, scalping, raping, enslaving others. Many wrestle with the morality of it all. Britt is a hero on the white man's side as he risks his life to find Indian captives and bring them back home to their own culture, but what to do with the ones taken as babies who know no other way of life. It is wrong that they have been stolen and yet they do not want to leave what they consider there homes. While Britt is a respected man for what he does, he's never allowed to forget the colour of his own skin as he enters city centres and must use back doors or cannot even enter certain establishments at all. A gripping, thought-provoking book peopled with real life figures from history."}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1887310-irene", "userReview": "When doing research for another book, Jiles came across Britt Johnson, a freed slave who settled with his wife and children in southern Oklahoma in the 1860s. In this book, Jiles imagines a life for this man about whom history has kept little record. Although Johnson inspired this novel, his story is only one of many threads that Jiles tries to follow. This is historical fiction about the clash of cultures between the native peoples of the southern Great Plains and the American settlers who arrived with an abundance of cultural imperialism certain that the indigenous nations would be grateful to exchange the land for the chance to be enculturated into European norms and lifestyles. Needless to say, the result was brutal bloodshed, captivity, impoverishment and hardships for all, especially the natives who lost land, language, autonomy, and most of their culture by the time all was over. I had the impression that Jiles was more interested in teaching history than in unfolding a story. This book had the literary feel of one of those documentaries where a historian\u2019s voice narrates and explains events while footage of that piece of history unspools on the screen. Her descriptions were vivid enough that I could see it all, but her tendency to tell rather than show, left me at a distance from the characters and events. The sense that I was being given a history lesson was compounded by the number of details and scenes that were historically interesting, but did nothing to further the narrative. This is a low 3 stars for me, just above average."}, {"userName": "Suzy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6942006-suzy", "userReview": "One of my favorite books of 2016 was News of the World, so good it will perhaps be one of my favorite books of all time. In it we meet Captain Kidd, elderly civil war veteran who roams north Texas in 1870 reading newspapers from far and wide to settlers hungry for news. On one of his trips, he is asked to return a captive girl to her people hundreds of miles away, hired by freighter Britt Johnson.Real-life Britton Johnson, born a slave in Tennessee, moved with his wife and children and slave-owner Moses Johnson to north Texas toward the end of the Civil War. A larger-than-life character in the settlement of this area and in the wars with the Comanche and Kiowa, he is the focus of this book, written seven years before NotW. The themes of this book are writ large - peace treaties with the Indian Tribes, freedom for slaves, Indian raids, killing and capture of settlers, futile government programs designed to tame the Indians, recapture of people taken captive, etc. Two distinct story lines make this a thrilling and educational read. First is the killing of Britt's oldest son and the capture of his wife and remaining two children in the Elm Creek Raid in 1864. We follow Britt in his quest to find and bring home his wife and children as well as a neighbor and her granddaughter. The other story line, which did not engage me as much, but was still interesting was that of Indian agent, Quaker Samuel Hammond who has been sent to enforce the peace treaties and negotiate the return of captives. I did not know that the government assigned enforcement of the peace treaties to religious organizations and the peaceable Quakers were unlucky enough to be chosen to work with the Comanches and Kiowa, notoriously violent tribes. I pretty much thought that NotW was the perfect novel -compact, focused, and beautifully written touching all the right emotions. The Color of Lightning came close, although the sprawling nature of the storylines and the importance of the things Jiles writes about sometimes got in the way. In some passages, Jiles' research dominated the story, especially that of Samuel Hammond. But none of this stopped me from enjoying this book - recommended! I also endorse the audiobook.Here's a little more information on Britt Johnson from the Texas State Historical Association. https://tshaonline.org/handbook/onlin..."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Anze", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27117957-stephanie-anze", "userReview": "Britt Jonhson is a former slave. Having been granted his freedom, his wife Mary, their three children and himself move to Texas so he can establish his freight business. On a day that Britt is away, their settlement is attacked by a band of Kiowa and Comanche. Whomever was not slained, was captured and among that group is Mary and her children. Thus Britt becomes determined to find and rescue his family.This is my second novel by Paulette Jiles. Having previously read News of the World this year, I was taken in by her writting. Speaking of which, Britt Jonhson makes an appearance in News of the World: he is the one that gets Johanna back from the Kiowa and asks Captain Kidd to bring her back to her family (this is not a spoiler). Taking place in Texas, towards the end of the Civil War, this novel highlights the struggles between the Indian natives and the settlers. As both sides feel they have been wronged, they fight constantly so an agency is established to bridge the differences, which garners mixed results. This is a dark period of US history. I wavered between a three and four star rating for a while but ultimately settled on four as the prose is beautifully written. It is worth mentioning that Jiles does not hold back on the brutality of the raids and attacks. This, however, has a purpose. As it turns out, Britt Johnson is a real person that managed to negotiate the release of several people from the tribes as well as establish a successful freight business.

The clash between a black freedman, the raiding tribes of Comanche and Kiowa and a Quaker Indian Agent seem to capture the monumental forces changing the country. The civil war was over, but black men were still less than citizens. Small pox had done its damage among the Indians, with long-reaching consequences, and the Comanche and Kiowa could not see themselves becoming farmers. The buffalo still roamed, but repeating rifles and the locomotive were just entering the scene. The story of Britt Johnson, a freed Kentucky slave who moves to Texas, is based on a real person, part of Texas' oral history tradition. Paulette Jiles takes the bare-bones facts of his life and creates a historical fiction that portrays a compassionate understanding of the these people caught at the crossroads. This compassionate tone is captured well in the character of James Deaver, traveling illustrator for the newspapers, covering stories on the Indians: \"They are our great mystery. They are America's great otherwise. People fall back in the face of an impenetrable mystery and refuse it. Yes, they take captives. Sometimes they kill women and old people. But the settlers are people who shouldn't be where they are in the first place and they know it and they take their chances...Perhaps we can regard this as a tragedy. Americans are not comfortable with tragedy. Because of its insolubility. Tragedy is not amenable to reason and we are fixers, aren't we? We can fix everything.\" (p. 185)"}, {"userName": "Jennifer (JC-S)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283014-jennifer-jc-s", "userReview": "\u2018All he had was the story of his life\u2019 In 1863, the American Civil War is still being fought and, in the way of all wars, provides opportunities for some as well as destruction for many. Ms Jiles has written this novel around the life of Britt Johnson, a former Kentucky slave.Britt Johnson, with his wife Mary and their three children, have moved to the Texas plains in search of their dreams. A brutal Indian attack results in the death of Britt\u2019s eldest son and the capture of his wife and other children. Britt seeks to recover his family and to establish a business carrying goods across the plains. Britt is ultimately successful in both of these endeavours, and earns the respect of many. While, generally, the cultural differences between the invaders and the invaded led to much misunderstanding and heartbreak on both sides, there were individuals (including Britt Johnson) who sought to understand.This novel portrays the brutality of the times, together with the struggle between the Americans themselves in relation to slavery, as well as the warfare between the Americans and the Indians for possession of land. These were turbulent years. Individuals fought for possessions and souls, while armies fought for territory and superiority of strength.I enjoyed this novel: the story of Britt Johnson caught my attention.

I have loved all three of her novels, and while \"Stormy Weather\" is my favorite, I really loved this one too--it was a page turner. It's the imagined/fictionalized story of Britt Johnson--an ex-slave who appears in north Texas histories because he rescued his captive family from Comanche and Kiowa tribes. Not much is known about him, so Jiles states on her acknowledgment page that she wanted to write his story, and while the book is a work of fiction, it's deeply rooted in real events, characters, and north Texas history. It's the story of Britt and his family who move to Texas in 1864 seeking a home where they can live and be free, the Quaker Samuel Hammond who is assigned to be the Indian Agent in the area and whose ideals are shattered, and the plight of the Comanche and Kiowa people who refuse to be penned into a reservation.

The most eloquently expressed concept is the psychological stress of capture and forced assimilation into another culture -- and the even more stressful prospect of being returned.

What I liked was the portrayal of yet another attempt by the US government to come to terms with the warlike Indian tribes who lived in Indian territory where the army and state lawmen were forbidden to travel into. So of course the tribes would raid the settlers, as they had raided others for generations, and then troop back to safety. Obviously this was untenable, but the US government was trying to figure out what it could do through provision of goods and farming supplies to change the path of the these tribes, but the agents for the government were craven men who sidetracked most of the provisions for their own enrichment. SO it was decided to have church groups administer the programs, and the book follows a Quaker who heads out to Fort Sill to work with the Kiowa and Commanches. But even though he is honest, the Indians have no interest in farming or otherwise giving up their raiding ways, so the program continues to fail and the Quaker eventually gives up his plan never to use the army, and begins arresting the chiefs. This of course also didn't work, but the book does give a very credible look at how it was hard and why it was hard for the US government to be effective.The freed slave has his portions of the story, as he comes to meet with Indians who stole his family and bargains them back. He also carved out a solid capitalist life as a hauler between remote towns, in part because he got on well enough with the Indians that they wouldn't attack him (until they killed him). But when we came to these portions of the book, I had the feeling that the author wasn't really carrying out a planned out story but simply putting our hero back on the road. His story didn't feel like a crafted tale of the sort that would be in a novel. And indeed that was so--because it followed his life in somewhat accurate form, it was not a crafted tale but instead a recitation, in novel format, of what is known of this man's life. And so since I thought I was reading a novel, sometimes it felt like the author was just setting forth the tale. Perhaps if I had known that from the beginning I might have reacted differently, but I felt the plot construction was a little weak at times, which may not be a fair criticism of this kind of book.

A freed slave operating as a freight hauler in Texas in the years after the Civil War, Britt Johnson plots to rescue his stolen wife and children from the Kiowa and the Comanche tribes. This is not a subject I would have sought out, but now, because of Jiles' incredible writing, I'm all in to dive down for more. Some truly terrifying scenes with gruesome detail told in a matter of fact, unflinching style, blast right through her pages amid gorgeous, lyrical prose. She manages to convey the tangled, many sided issues the tribes, black and white settlers, and the US Army were forced to solve piecemeal as the US continued its expansion through the West. She does this mainly through character, dialogue and storyline- an astonishing feat. I learned an enormous amount about this period but never through the boggy and annoying exposition that can pull me out of the story in some historical fiction books.Paulette Jiles is a stunning writer. \"News\" was more spare, both in pages and style, but both of these books have incredible stories, well drawn characters and writing that is so evocative and compelling that I found myself frustrated the book was coming to an end even as I raced towards the inevitable conclusion. I will now backtrack and read every single thing Jiles has written."}, {"userName": "Wisteria Leigh", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1276167-wisteria-leigh", "userReview": "If you are a New Englander, you can\u2019t appreciate the panoramic beauty of the western plains, overshadowing mountains and vast visual omnipresence of beauty of anyplace else unless you have been there. In The Color of Lightning, Paulette Jiles told this story as if she was recapturing the travels of Lewis and Clark. With a palette of colorful prose, a prism of grandness is picturesquely painted. This period of history presents hope and despair, promise and disappointment, good times and bad. As Americans move west, after the Civil War, settlers, black men and women are now free.As in any historical conflict, there are two sides, and the author handles this with delicacy and honesty serving up no blame. Opposing the grace and grandeur of the setting is the actions of the characters in the novel. With the violent bloody brutality that the settlers face with the Kiowa and Comanche, the author details the grim desperate reality of their life. The author does not diminish the harsh, hostile and violent treatment doled out by the enemy. I was surprised by the author\u2019s honesty and commend her for adhering to historical accuracy. The Color of Lightning was a spectacular achievement of storytelling quality."}, {"userName": "itpdx", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/558587-itpdx", "userReview": "This is a well written fictional imagining of the life of Brett Johnson, a freed slave who settled in north Texas toward the end of the Civil War. Jiles writes with a wonderful poetic hand. She keeps the story moving. She lays the historical foundation without becoming pendantic. She leaves the reader with much to ponder about race, colonialism, religion and war. For those interested in this history, I would highly recommend Empire of the Summer Moon: Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History by S.C. Gwynne."}, {"userName": "Susannah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1352895-susannah", "userReview": "THIS BOOK SHOULD COME WITH A HUGE TRIGGER WARNING. Truth to tell, I didn't make it very far into this book. Much as I adore Ms Jiles' work, I felt shocked and dismayed at how little prepared I was for the sickening violence that began only a few pages into the story. If I had wanted to read an accurate portrayal of the horrors faced by some early settlers, I would have picked up a clearly-marked non-fiction historical narrative. That the story wheels so suddenly from the interpersonal struggles of the characters as they adjust to a new life to a terrifyingly descriptive, jaw-dropping scene that sadly is all too real without warning is just too triggering for a reader with PTSD, or for those who simply do not have the stomach for this kind of violence. It may be exactly what some readers want, but not me, thanks. I was thrown completely out of the story, and that makes me sad, because Ms Jiles' other works are some of my most favorite."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/209011-lisa", "userReview": "I didn't love Enemy Women like most everyone else did, and I feel the same towards this novel. There's just something about Jiles' style of writing I just seem to not care for. The subject and time are fascinating and I enjoyed learning about the amazing story of Britt Johnson. I really liked the first half of the book, but I thought it was slow and disjointed after he rescues his family. I thought Samuel and his story line were never fully developed and therefore I thought it slowed the story down. I would totally recommend the book because it was so interesting, but I feel the story would have been better told by another author. Maybe this comes from just reading The Heretic's Daughter, which is similar in that both authors took an actual historic event and wove non-fiction around it.............I thought Kathleen Kent did a better job in that respect."}, {"userName": "Deborah Bausmith", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56139412-deborah-bausmith", "userReview": "It was an amazing mixture of people who lived in the plains of northern Texas right after the Civil War--free Blacks, soldiers, Native Americans trying to deal with disappearing land & buffalo, & white settlers.

Britt Johnson is a strong and quietly determined ex-slave whose wife, children, and some neighbors are kidnapped by Indians. He is brave, relentless, and resourceful in tracking them down and seeking their release. The supporting characters along the way, of all races and occupations, are interesting and sufficiently rich in their particularities. Jiles clearly knows the territory and its ambience from the inside out, and nonetheless has not only rendered the narrative in poetic detail, but has meticulously researched the period so that details emerge that offer a depth of immersion into that beautifully stark and perilous time and region. The climax of the book is as beautifully crafted, poetically rich and piercingly tragic as any I have seen of its kind and stands worthily next to what Cormac McCarthy writes. Many, many examples could be cited of Jiles\u2019s brilliant injection of moments where something turns or drops or flees, whether from a look or the body or something in the landscape. Which leads me to my one problem with the novel. Except for some references here and there, the main character Britt Johnson not only talks with scarcely a dialect or accent or idioms of his race and culture, but he is rarely confronted with the abusive treatment that would otherwise be visited on a black man in that period. I say this as the similarly white author of a novel, FAR STONES, set in the same region and time period and with African-American protagonists. I can only guess it was an authorial decision to not make an homage to a brave man complicated or distracted by the problematic issues of race. But, according to S.C. Gwynne\u2019s EMPIRE OF THE SUMMER MOON, he was known in his region as Nigger Britt Johnson, and while highly respected and regarded, Nigger was how he was known\u2014a derogation of his personhood built in to how he was addressed\u2014presumably regularly by those whites who truly regarded him with respect and affection. Thus, it makes him even more respectworthy that he persevered in the face of inevitable abasement\u2014AND it means, in my view, he found some way to present himself as both not a threat to whites thereabouts and as a man of action who was of enormous help to the fragile community of settlers.A book well, well worth the read. I simply counsel how likely even more brave and praiseworthy Britt Johnson than therein depicted."}, {"userName": "Marie desJardins", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3892251-marie-desjardins", "userReview": "I just could not read this entire book -- I'm sure it is historically accurate, and I am well aware that the history of our country is full of violence and hostility between white (and black) settlers and native Americans. But the degree of graphic, explicit, brutal murder and rape is too much for me. I don't care for the writing style, either -- it's turgid and indirect, with a lot of plodding details in small side points like the way the butler turns around, or the glistening mint jelly on the lamb.I did flip through the rest of the book before I set it aside or wrote this review, to see whether there was \"soaring lyricism\" (or whatever inspiring moments the book jacket promises), and I couldn't find any redemption or beauty. Maybe it's just too subtle for me, or maybe I just can't take any more negativity in this age of Trump. I'm leaving it behind in the hotel room and buying a happier book at the airport."}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23295044-bruce", "userReview": "Really loved this book, which reads like the love child of Cormac McCarthy and Laura Ingalls Wilder. Lots of lushly wild and beautiful writing here adorning a straight-up stone-cold hero narrative in post-Civil War Texas. Highly recommended!"}], "description": "In 1863, as the War Between the States creeps inevitably toward its bloody conclusion, former Kentucky slave Britt Johnson ventures west into unknown territory with his wife, Mary, and their three children, searching for a life and a future. But their dreams are abruptly shattered by a brutal Indian raid upon the Johnsons' settlement while Britt is away establishing a business. Returning to find his friends and neighbors slain or captured, his eldest son dead, his beloved and severely damaged Mary enslaved, and his remaining children absorbed into an alien society that will never relinquish its hold on them, the heartsick freedman vows not to rest until his family is whole again.   A soaring work of the imagination based on oral histories of the post-Civil War years in North Texas, Paulette Jiles's The Color of Lightning is at once an intimate look into the hearts and hopes of tragically flawed human beings and a courageous reexamination of a dark American history.", "title": "The Color Of Lightning", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6098570-the-color-of-lightning", "average": 4.02, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1329709330l/6098570.jpg", "reviews": 372, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/70102.Paulette_Jiles", "name": "Paulette Jiles"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Westerns", "Historical", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6098570-the-color-of-lightning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6100621-the-color-of-lightning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7897842-the-color-of-lightning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7693829-the-color-of-lightning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13620512-the-color-of-lightning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25817493-news-of-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/399395.Enemy_Women", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/467316.Stormy_Weather", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349213-lighthouse-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1076133.North_Spirit"]}
