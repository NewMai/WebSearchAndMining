That\u2019s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we\u2019ll never get back.\n  \nHOLY WOW! It Ends With Us is one of the most powerful books of 2016 and one of the most raw, honest, inspiring, and profoundly beautiful stories I've ever read. It wasn\u2019t anything like what I expected, but it delivered so much more than I ever hoped for. This is the kind of book that I want to give to every woman and just be like\u2026 READ THIS BOOK. NOW. Come to think of it, all the men should read it too. EVERYONE should read this book. Absolutely everyone. It's a story of unshakable love and finding the strength to make the right choice in the hardest situation. I honestly don't think I've ever been prouder of a heroine. I've loved Colleen Hoover's books for a long time because she always writes unique stories... and this one left a lasting mark on my heart. It is a MUST-READ!!This is a completely \n  spoiler-free review\n. I'm not even going to add the blurb or tell you what this book is about. It's a Colleen Hoover book. That should be enough to tell you it's amazing. But I really feel that you should just dive into this book without knowing anything about the plot. To be honest, I'm the usually the kind of reader who likes to know every little thing about what to expect in advance, but I've really learned to trust Colleen's writing and her storytelling so even I went into this book without knowing anything at all... and I was blown away by the story!This book is unputdownable. You'll notice as you read that there are no good stopping points. None at all. I began reading it late at night and every time I tried to put it down to go to sleep, I just had to get back up and keep reading because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I didn't finish until almost 5AM but my gosh was it ever worth it!Of all the heroines I've ever read, Lily was most certainly one of the ones I admired the most. I knew loved her from the first few pages, but having finished the book, I truly couldn't be prouder of her. Her strength and conviction over the course of this story made her into a heroine I'd want every girl and woman to read about and look up to. She was so real and vulnerable as we all are, but the strength with which she took control of her life was admirable on such a deep level. I just wanted to hug her and cheer. I don't think I've been this proud of a fictional character before.There's an incredibly powerful message in this book that is very subtly woven in from the start. It begins in the first chapter, but you don't yet realize how significant each of these moments truly are... and as you read more, these pieces of the story come together forming a scenario that gives such a raw, honest portrayal of an incredibly relevant issue. I'm not mentioning it on purpose because I don't want you to expect it. The fact that it's unexpected for you as the reader is very important because it's also unexpected for the heroine. As she begins to realize what kind of situation she's in, so do you. And this realization very much allows you to experience her journey with her.The only thing I want to address head on is the question of the 'love triangle' because a few of you have read the blurb and have asked about it. All I want to say is to please try and move away from that thought. I don't want to spoil the plot at all, but that is so not what this book is about. That is not the point, or the focus. Whatever it is you're thinking this book is, just trust me -- it's so much bigger than that. Seriously, trust Colleen. I did.As a romance reader, I found this book incredibly refreshing. As much as I adore the romance genre (and I really do), it sometimes can get a little repetative. As both an avid reader and a blogger, I'm always looking for books that step outside the lines a little; ones that do something different or take the issues a little deeper. This book represented exactly what I wish I could be reading all the time -- not this literal story, but just the fact that it went in such a different direction and gave me such an unexpected story that left me with such a strong message.One of the things that intrigued me the most and had me wondering when I heard about this book was what the title really meant -- and there's this very specific moment when the title is echoed in the story that just had such a strong impact as I read it. That was my cheer moment. I just sat back and went 'woah!'. The title is truly perfect.In order to write this review, I went back over the book a second time and one thing I noticed strongly was how many intricate layers there were to the story that I couldn't possibly have known about in my first read. I loved that this is one of those books you experience differently (in a good way) both the first and second time though.I have to say that this book would make a seriously amazing movie. I could picture every scene so clearly as I read. This is also such an incredibly relevant story for many people -- whether they've personally been through what happened to Lily or they know of someone who has -- so I really do hope that one day this makes it to the big screen.My copy of this book is literally filled with highlighted quotes in every single chapter but I made a conscious decision not to add any to this review because I really truly do not want to give anything away about the story. Just trust me and jump into this story blind. I promise that it is a reading experience you don't want to miss.This began as one of my most highly anticipated books of 2016 and it is now of my top favorite books of the year. I was unable to put it down from the moment I started reading and I know that this is one of those profoundly beautiful and unforgettable stories that will stay with me for a long time. I highly recommend it to \n  everyone\n!\n  \n    That\u2019s what fifteen minutes can do to a person. It can destroy them.It can save them.\n  \nRating: 5+ STARS!

Reading this book will change your life. It\u2019s so different from any of Colleen Hoover\u2019s other books. You can tell it\u2019s heavier, more personal, just more. This book is deep. It\u2019s profound. It\u2019s a book that needs to be read. I'll repeat: THIS IS A BOOK THAT NEEDS TO BE READ! This story is moving. It will make you think about things that are uncomfortable to think about. It will lift your heart, devastate you at times, make you proud, fill you with sorrow and make you smile. It will move you. It\u2019s powerful and intense in the best way, but also has hopeful and lighter moments. The story itself is one that has been heavy on my heart from the moment I finished it. Sometimes, I read a book and it\u2019s so beautiful, influential and emotional I will cry just thinking about the characters and their story. Not in a bad way necessarily, I just get that moved and that emotional while thinking about it. That is this book. Trying to find the words for this review is bringing me to tears. It\u2019s hard to explain the story completely spoiler free, but this isn\u2019t a \u2018sad\u2019 book. It\u2019s a strength book. Because dealing with the issues in this story took so much strength. \n  I\u2019m not going to talk about the actual story at all, but I will speak a bit about the characters. Lily. Speaking of strength, Lily may be the strongest heroine that I\u2019ve read about. Your strength is really tested when you are put in a hard situation where your choices are impossible. I loved Lily so much. I was proud of Lily and the choices she made. I want to be Lily when I grow up. \n  Fifteen seconds. That\u2019s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we\u2019ll never get back.\nThere are two men in this story, but please don\u2019t think this is a triangle book. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s hard to explain, but it\u2019s not. Ryle is a charming guy. He\u2019s a giving person. He\u2019s got a lot of great attributes. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve ever felt so conflicted over a character as I did him. Atlas is the type of man I always have a soft spot for as a reader. His story gutted me at times, but he is also a character with a lot of strength and so much beauty. I loved Atlas from the second I met him and that love never stopped throughout the book. \n  \n  \u201cLily?\u201d he whispers, looking at me sincerely. \u201cYou just might be the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d\n\u2028Aside from the three main characters in the story, Lily\u2019s mom played a prominent part. Their relationship played an even bigger part. Ryle\u2019s sister and Lily\u2019s best friend Alyssa was one of my favorite characters in this book. When things got hard she was there. One line she said in the book, to Lily just solidified the type of woman she was. Coleen always writes that one side character that you love so hard in her stories, and Alyssa was that character for me. I can\u2019t not mention Ellen, because, well, it\u2019s Ellen. That part was brilliant. It made me smile every time Ellen was mentioned. \n  When reading this book, there were moments I struggled between not being able to tear my eyes away from the page, and others I had to take a breather because I couldn't handle what was going on.Parts of this story left me so heartbroken and others lifted me up so high. There are some parts that are just so powerful I could only read them in awe. This is it. This is why I read. Books like this. \n  \n    All humans make mistakes. What determines a person\u2019s character aren\u2019t the mistakes we make. It\u2019s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.\n  \n\u2028Colleen Hoover is an author who truly has a way with words. She killed this book. I\u2019ve read and loved all of CoHo\u2019s books. Some of her earlier books are some of my all-time favorites. I\u2019ve enjoyed all of her latest books, but this is by far the best book she\u2019s ever written. And it\u2019s tied with Hopeless as my own personal favorite book by her. And that is saying a lot, because Hopeless is one of my top books ever. \u2028\u2028If you only read one book this year, let it be It Ends with Us. Everyone needs to read this book. 5+ star favorite. Completely unforgettable and highly recommended! \n  \n    \u201cIt stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30035966-angela", "userReview": "It Ends With Us... Wow I really don't know what to truly say about this novel. This review will be a little light because, like most CoHo books, you'll want to go into it with little to no information. I went into this book thinking it was going to be this one thing, and it turned out to be the complete opposite. IEWU follows Lily, a girl in her early twenties, who has never had it easy. Though coming from a family that was better off she has always had to work for the things she's wanted. After graduating college she gets up and moves to Boston and hopes to start her own business. While there she meets and falls for Ryle, a thriving neurosurgeon who is determined to be the best in his field. The two hit it off hard, and things seem almost too good to be true. Ryle is everything that Lily is not. He is forward, assertive, and stubborn. He is also a lot of thing Lily is; he is strong, passionate, and motivated. Though the two have an immediate connections and sparks fly, the two decided to take their time getting to know one another. Lily is such a beautifully written leading lady. I loved getting to grow with her and be apart of her journey. I loved hearing her thoughts and seeing how she processed things. When I was first reading and got to the point where she does her journal entries, but she does them so they are letters to Ellen DeGeneres, I thought I wasn't going to like that aspect of it. The first few had me thinking \"this is a little cheesy\", but the more I got into it the more I started to enjoy them. They really tied Lily's past and present perfectly together. As Lily's and Ryle's relationship pushes forward she finds herself looking back at those entries and thoughts of her first love Atlas resurface. Atlas was her first everything and was the biggest impact on her life. Atlas was the homeless boy who found his way into the abandoned house next door. Atlas and Lily as teens formed an unlikely friendship. Sharing everything and having a bond that no one around them seemed to understand. Spending every possible moment together and having so many stolen ones the two were kindred spirits. When Atlas reappears in the story it truly threatens everything Lily and Ryle have. (not a spoiler it's given he eventually will). Both Ryle and Atlas bring such important and different aspects to this story. I think CoHo manages to make them both such polar opposites, but at the same time manages to make them mesh so well.The characters in the book, main or side, all feel so realistic and authentic. When it comes to the plot there is almost nothing I can say about it. I hope everyone will do the same to keep things from getting spoiled. The story is an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. It's one of those books that you will have a thousand theories about and all of them will be wrong. I kept trying to guess what I thought might happen next and in classic Hoover style she managed to surprise me. This book was solid from page one and was steady throughout, but around the 80% mark is where things really took a turn (in the best way possible).\u00a0 IEWU hit me on such a personal level. I didn't expect this book to impact me so hard. It had everything I wanted from a New Adult read. It's very classic CoHo, but it also branches out somewhere she's never been before, but she does it with such ease. She manages to weave these heavy moments with ones that will make you swoon, laugh, and then cry. My favorite part of this book though, was the author's note. Usually author's notes are at the beginning of the story, however it is so important that this one was left for the end. It took a book that was good and made it exceptional! God, this note effected me like so few books have. It made me cry fifty times harder than the entire book or anything Colleen's ever written.\n  Finding out how important this book was for her to write will hit you hard, but I hope she also knows how important it is as a reader to read. Knowing where an author gets their ideas from can change your whole outlook on a book, and this one... this one broke me.Thank you Colleen Hoover for continuing to gift the reading community with your words.

Don't ask me why, I really don't know. What I do know is that I haven't been on Goodreads in nearly six months and it's entirely your fault that i'm here now. So, if i stumble upon a poor review on one of my books and end up in the fetal position on my kitchen floor surrounded by Ding Dong wrappers, well, I'm blaming it on you. I've even given my husband instructions to bill you for the psychiatry bill if that happens.On Friday I had a hysterectomy. It wasn't the worst day of my life, but it certainly wasn't the best. One chapter of my life--quite possibly the best chapter--ended. The surgery itself took twenty minutes. Twenty minutes. Can you believe that? Twenty minutes to take out the uterus that carried my three beautiful babies for a total of twenty eight months. Twenty minutes to change my life. Don't feel bad for me, that's not what I want. The offending organ had to come out, I knew this. But it didn't make it any easier. It didn't make the finality of the situation any easier. In all honesty, for a couple of minutes I didn't just feel like a chapter was ending, more like an entire flipping book. Maybe my life isn't made up of chapters, maybe it's part of a duet, or a trilogy? Either way, part of my story was over. Over a matter of several hours, I slowly woke up from surgery and at one point I remember sitting there and just staring at the wall paper in my hospital room. My uterus was gone. Mauve diamonds. The wallpaper was covered in mauve diamonds.That's the most hideous color, don't you think? Mauve. Not quite pink. Not quite maroon. I counted seven hundred and fifty three diamonds before I allowed the first tear to fall. But I wasn't just crying for losing a part of my body, and I wasn't crying for losing the ability to carry more children. I was crying because some women don't even get to experience what I've gotten to experience. Some women never get to have babies. They never get to feel them grow in their bellies. They never get to see the slimy little monsters as they tumble their way into this world.And I did.I got to do all of that three times.So why was I so upset? What the hell was my problem? I should be grateful, right? Happy?My husband slept soundly in the chair, snoring softly, but at some point my cries must have woken him up. He stirred and I did the only thing I could do ... I grabbed your book. You see, it was sitting on my bedside table. I buried my nose between the pages and when my better half asked me if I was okay I simply peeked over the top of the book and whispered, \"Colleen. She did it again.\"I didn't need to say much more, he knows my obsession with your words and I found myself grateful. Grateful that he knew your books make me cry and grateful that you inadvertently allowed me to grieve. And that's what I did. I read your book and I grieved. I cried when Lily cried. I cried when Ryle cried. And even when no one was crying, I still cried simply because I needed to and I could and no one thought twice about it because i was reading and that's what i do when i read. It was my outlet, my excuse for the tears that wouldn't go away, the tears that kept falling despite my desperate protest.I cried for all of the Lily's in the world, and the Ryle's too. I cried for the Atlas'. And I cried for the Kirby's (that's my name. No i'm not named after a vacuum, or a cream puff)But you see, I didn't want to cry. I didn't want to be upset. I have three beautiful children whom I love with my entire heart. My body did it's job extremely well and that is something to be proud of. But why wasn't I proud? Naked truth?I'm selfish.I wanted one more baby even though my husband didn't. I wanted one more baby when there are women out there that can't have any at all.So why am I telling you this? My story is nothing like Lily's. Not even close. But maybe it is ... She wanted something she shouldn't want. I wanted something I couldn't have. She had a decision to make ... one that would change her life. So did I. She made a decision that was right for her and for her life at that particular time. Ditto.But the real reason I'm telling you this is because for two days I was drowning and It Ends With Us was my lifeline. It's what I grabbed when I needed to stop thinking ... it's what I grabbed when i needed to cry ... and when i finally finished the book and put it down, it wasn't mauve diamonds that I saw ... it was my smiling children.My three beautiful smiling children ... and my niece Lily. -- Kirby"}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16384209-candace", "userReview": "Phenomenal! This book will make you fall in love, rip your heart out and force you to reconsider your preconceived ideas about abuse. This is the most moving book that I've read in a LONG time. It was absolutely addicting, but so difficult at times. I don't cry very often, but this one had me crying big, fat tears. It's been a couple of days since I finished 'It Ends With Us' and I'm still thinking about Lily's story. It's one that'll hang with you. In so many ways, her story gutted me. Yet, it was also inspiring.Lily grows up in an abusive household. After watching her mother suffer for years at the hand of her father, she tells herself that she'll never allow any man to treat her that way. She grows into a strong and independent woman, leaving behind the horrors of her childhood...Or so she thinks.Despite everything she's promised herself, Lily finds herself in an abusive relationship. The behavior and cycle is so insidious that you almost can't believe what is happening. Ms. Hoover manages to weave the violence into a relationship that is otherwise seemingly perfect. It is so skillfully written that you won't want to believe what you've read.  I found myself making excuses for the abuser. I didn't want to believe that he wouldn't change. For the first time, I could understand why women make excuses for abusers. I can only imagine how strong that pull must be in reality if I felt so strongly about a fictional character. I am in awe of Lily. Her strength and conviction blew me away. I don't think I would've been strong enough to do what she did. She was an amazing character.This was a beautiful and heartbreaking book. I recommend it to everyone. It is a must read."}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "*Spoilers*I did not see that coming.Which I think is the whole point. Ever since I was fifteen, I promised myself I would never get into a relationship with someone before I knew what they looked like angry. Are they the type to grow exasperated and leave the room, shout their lungs out or\u2026 aggressively hit their loved ones?I\u2019m very happy with the way Colleen Hoover dealt with the subject of abuse. It\u2019s very well explored and the connection between Lily and her mother so beautiful yet so sad. But mostly beautiful because of how well they end up understanding one another.To be completely honest, I wanted to stay way away from this book. The last CoHo books I had read \u2013 UGLY LOVE and NOVEMBER 9 \u2013 annoyed me with their cheesy lines and insta-love-dovey. But this\u2026 this is something else entirely. I loved how it follows Lily for several years and how we even get access to her past. It not only made her character much more three-dimensional\u2014real, but it also showed sides of her we otherwise would never have seen. She is so strong and wise. So motivated and ambitious. So good and compassionate. I loved her. And truth be told, I want to be her.I think this book has truly renewed my faith in Colleen Hoover. I almost gave up on reading her books for ever, but then impulsion struck me and I succumbed to this one as well. Very glad I did. I hope you will, too. It\u2019s worth it. PS. The title is one of the most well thought of that exist. When the author used the sentence in her novel, all kinds of emotions welled up inside me.

And then I'm both. And it's the worst, because there is a war raging inside me, and the winner side keeps changing. How is it possible to switch from denial to sorrow to fury to acceptance in a heartbeat?\n  \n    \u201cThere is no such thing as bad people. We\u2019re all just people who sometimes do bad things.\u201d \n  \nI did my best not to cry. I felt sick, but I clenched my jaw and forced myself to keep reading, trying in vain to ignore the tremors that ran through my body. But when the last chapters came, and Colleen's note in the end, I couldn't take it any more. I dissolved into angry, hot tears, and I checked my chest to make sure my heart was not bleeding. Lily's story had a lot to teach. I think I died a little when I realized that sometimes love is not enough. Regret, good will, they're not enough to fix some wounds. On the contrary, they make them deeper.\n  \n    \u201cJust because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.\u201d\n  \nIt Ends with Us is the most personal and daring and painful book Colleen Hoover has ever written. Abuse and domestic violence are a delicate subject, and when I found out they were this book's main theme I thought about not reading it. It was a moment of cowardice, a moment I didn't want to witness this side of relationships. But I owed it to myself, as a person and as a woman to proceed. Because pretending a problem doesn't exist does not make it disappear. There will be spoilers below so if you haven't read It Ends with Us, you should probably stop here.\n  \n    \u201cFifteen seconds. That\u2019s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen.\u201d \n  \nNaked truth coming. I was one of the people who don't understand. The people who, when they hear about abuse, the first thing that occurs to them is why doesn't she leave him? Why does she let her fear guide her, and she's so selfish that makes her children witness such horrors inside their home, that was supposed to be their sanctuary? But what we should ask is what is wrong with him? Instead of making excuses and trying to justify him, we should take a moment and consider how she feels, and the difficult decisions she has to make. Ryle broke my heart into millions of pieces. I fell in love with him, and I kept wishing that Colleen would delete these words, these scenes that hurt me and disappointed me and shattered my belief in happy endings. A part of me, a part I tried to smother, a part I am ashamed that exists, wanted him to change. To try harder, and for Lily to let him try harder. Me, who judged them for not leaving. In the end, I felt sorry for Ryle. For losing the love of his life, for destroying his only chance at happiness. I don't forgive him, I just wish that a magic wand would make everything better.\n  \n    \u201cSo much gravity, pushing down on my emotions. Everything shatters.My tears, my heart, my laughter, my soul. Shattered like broken glass, raining down around me.\u201d \n  \nLily is a hero. She had dignity, and courage and strength. At first I was judging her mother for staying, but witnessing through Lily's eyes her challenges, feeling her heartbreak and her dilemmas, made me regret all the ugly things I thought. Loving the person who hurts you is a greater torture than the physical act itself. And damn it I loved Ryle, and I hated Colleen for that. I hated her for making me swoon and laugh when she was about to shatter my soul. The Katerina that started It Ends with Us is a different person than the Katerina that finished it. Remorseful, destroyed, wiser.\n  \n    \u201cLife is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.\u201d \n  \nA part of me wants to forget this raw, powerful, inspirational, beautiful and ugly book. But the dominant part, even though it suffers, is glad I read it and learned.To every single person out there, READ IT.To every woman in Lily's place, BE BRAVE AND BOLD.To Colleen Hoover, THANK YOU.

Dear God! It's amazing how you can read a story that is simultaneously gut wrenching and beautiful. I'll be honest, I managed to make it through this ENTIRE book without shedding a single tear... until I hit CoHo's note/acknowledgements at the end and ugly cried. The fact that this story had so much basis on real life events that meant so much to her shined through in her writing. Clearly you can guess the ending of the story (to some degree) by the title, but a majority of what makes this story so breathtaking is the journey there. \"It Ends With Us\" caused me to look at domestic abuse in ways I never allowed myself to in the past. As a society we are quick to judge women (and men) who stay in abusive relationships without taking into account what the process really is like for them. We get a slight glimpse into the fragile situation of how incredibly difficult it is to leave a dangerous relationship when you love the person who is causing you harm. I won't say more for fear of ruining the reading experience for someone else, but this book was so much more than a flimsy romance novel. Highly recommended!

The thought of reading about a prolonged courtship isn't something to get all excited about. After all, how many people\u00a0out there are actually interested in hearing about my own misadventures in the dating arena?On second thought, don't answer that.So when I started diving into\u00a0It Ends with Us: A Novel by Colleen Hoover, I expected pages of the same old trite that have filled thousands of romance novels ever since the first caveman dragged the first cavechick by the hair back into his stone-age pad. Wouldn't you know it? I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Let's take a brief rundown of the requisite elements and see if this novel has them: Girl Meets Boy - CHECK \n   Boy is Impossibly Handsome - CHECK \n   Boy is Impossibly Rich - CHECK \n   Boy is Impossibly Talented - CHECK \n   Boy has Mysterious Name - CHECK \n   Boy is Emotionally Aloof\u00a0- CHECK \n   Girl Tries To Deny Feelings For Boy She Just Met - CHECK \n   Boy Makes A Move - CHECK \n   Girl Pretends Not To Like It - CHECK \n   Boy Says Something Clever and Sexy - CHECK \n   Boy and Girl Have Wild, Raunchy Sex\u00a0- CHECK \n  Okay, the last one actually doesn't happen for a good while owing to the tried-and-tested phone-call-interruption-just-when-we're-about-to-do-it cliche, but it's still there.Here's a description of when the two lovebirds first meet:I feel his voice in my stomach. That's not good. Voices should stop at the ears, but sometimes - not very often at all, actually - a voice will penetrate past my ears and reverberate straight down through my body. He has one of those voices. Deep, confident, and a little bit like butter.\n  Here's another one:This guy is beautiful. Well-manicured, smells like money, looks to be several years older than me. His eyes crinkle in the corners as they follow me, and his lips seem to frown, even when they aren't.Now, why would I give four stars to a book that overuses so many tropes?Because Colleen Hoover knows her audience so well it's almost criminal. Her writing is clean and lucid. The protagonist is fleshed-out. The story tugs at the heart. Everything else can be forgiven.And by the end of the first half of the book, it becomes painfully obvious that this novel is not about romance. It's about heartache.Our\u00a0protagonist is a 23-year old wannabe florist named Lily Blossom Bloom (yes) who meets brooding neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (again, yes).\u00a0Lily's father has recently passed, and she's\u00a0trying to come to terms with her less-than-stellar relationship with dear ol' dad. Flashbacks are interspersed throughout the book via Lily's high school diary, and we quickly find out that her first love was a homeless guy named Atlas Corrigan (for the last time, yes) who lived in an abandoned shack near her childhood home. To say that dad and Atlas did not get along is an understatement.Lily is a smart and driven woman, and it shows through her personality. She balances the pleasures of love with the pleasures of work. A couple chapters in, she decides to pursue her dream and open a flower shop:\"Sweet, life, pink, spring.\" I repeat. And then, \"Allysa, you're brilliant!\" I stand up and begin pacing the floor. \"We'll take everything everyone loves about flowers, and we'll do the complete opposite!\"Nice one, Lily.But of course, this wouldn't be a good novel if all we ever read about is how good Lily is getting it at the office and in the bedroom. Midway through, disaster strikes.I won't say what kind of disaster,\u00a0but there's quite a few of it, both in present time and in the flashbacks. And then there's love. And then there's disaster. And then there's love. And then there's disaster. And then there's love.This book may overuse so many things we've come to expect of romantic comedies, but when I figured out the real message Colleen wanted to impart, I\u00a0swept all the small things under the rug. This novel is a heartfelt plea for the readers to empathize with men and women who are caught up in relationships that are causing them turmoil and pain. It's a call to have an open mind when confronted with a similar relationship in the real world, both for the man, the woman, and their families. Finally, it leaves us with a beautiful if not sad moral lesson that the right thing to do may sometimes also be the hardest thing to do.People say that teenagers don't know how to love like an adult. Part of me believes that, but I'm not an adult so I have nothing to compare it to. But I do believe it's probably different. I'm sure there's more substance in the love between two adults than there is between two teenagers. There's probably more maturity, more respect, more responsibility. But no matter how different the substance of a love might be at different ages in a person's life, I know that love still has to weigh the same. You feel that weight on your shoulders and in your stomach and on your heart no matter how old you are.The book is peppered with phrases like the one above, and the more I read, the more I got the feeling that the words were coming from the author's mouth and not the protagonist's.At the beginning and end of the novel, there is a personal message left by the author, and the motivation for this book suddenly\u00a0becomes clear. They say writing is a private and cathartic process, and for Colleen, this certainly was extremely private and cathartic. It must have taken a lot of effort to write. It's only fair that it took\u00a0a lot of joy to read."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/\u201cWhat a great time to have a dissenting opinion about a book written by an author with a particularly rabid fanbase!\u201d said no one ever.

I didn\u2019t pick this up in order to hate on it. I\u2019m one of you . . . . sometimes. Definitely not this time, but lots of times. And this is why I don\u2019t ever give up on Hoover novels. I never know how I\u2019m going to react.Allow me to explain what went wrong for me with this one . . . \n  Let\u2019s start with the obvious annoyances that seem to be in nearly every NA book that drive me batshit before getting to the real nitty gritty. First, the character names. Ryle, Lily Bloom and Atlas???????\n  Is it against the law to not use absolutely ridiculous (\u2122Ron2.0) names in these books???? Second . . . . \n  \u201cYour lips. I love how they\u2019re as red as your hair.\u201d\n\n  According to Google (all hail Google) less than 2% of the world\u2019s population has red hair, and yet 99.998% of all NA leading ladies do. Just stahp.Third, non-existent chemistry. In this story Lily and Ryle meet by chance on a rooftop after experiencing respective miserable days. In a matter of minutes Lily goes from worrying the stranger on the roof could be a psycho killer/rapist to getting into his super sexy (NOT) pick-up lines . . . \n  \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t sleep with someone you just met . . .\u201d His eyes meet mine again. \u201cExactly how far would you go?\u201d\nEwww. She already said thanks but no thanks freakshow so STFU.Now let\u2019s move on to the real big issue. I took a gander at my friends\u2019 reviews before I started typing this and noticed my buddy Chelsea was the only other naysayer in the batch. She summed it up perfectly when she talked about the massive amounts of emotional manipulation that was forced down the readers\u2019 throats in order to make them feel all the things.It\u2019s a running joke with my friends/family/co-workers that I have a robot heart. And for the majority of the time it\u2019s true. I generally experience two emotions \u2013 happiness and annoyance. But even a robot like me can be manipulated into having a feeling/crying the ugly tears like a Kardashian once in a blue moon (*cough Me Before You cough*). This time, though? It was like a flashing neon sign . . . . \n  To begin with, our first leading male Atlas is a homeless teenager who Lily befriends/eventually loses her virginity. In case you don\u2019t get the writing on the wall, Atlas is being set up as the most perfect perfection that ever perfected. He\u2019s also the way to getting the \u201craised in an abusive household\u201d plotline uncovered. Like in all NA stories, Atlas and Lily are torn apart. Lily moves on with her life, graduates college, yada yada, and, as mentioned above, meet-cutes super creeper Mr. Right 2.0 on the roof. Mr. Right 2.0 is not only another most perfect perfection that ever perfected, but he\u2019s also rich and a neurosurgeon and very obviously husband material even though he\u2019s never had a girlfriend (also after dating only six months), annnnnnnnd due to their mutually busy schedules not really knowing the guy.It wasn\u2019t too hard to see where the story was going to go (and no, I hadn\u2019t been spoiled because I didn\u2019t read any reviews or the synopsis, I just auto-request everything by Hoover from both NetGalley and the library). Basically this was a story about domestic abuse and making excuses not only the first time he knocks your ass down \u201con accident\u201d but also the second time when you wake up after \u201cfalling\u201d down the stairs and hearing his sob story about a superbadawful that effed him up as a kid and then agreeing on a policy where \n  \u201cWhen you\u2019re upset, just walk away. And I\u2019ll walk away\u201d\n (because THAT\u2019S going to fucking work) and then saying \n  \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ryle. It\u2019s okay. You were angry, it\u2019s okay\u201d\n and making sure even when you\u2019re bleeding profusely out of your fucking skull and are concussed and have quite possibly just been raped by your own damn husband that you get taken to an emergency room in a hospital other than the one where your bastard abuser works in order to protect his ass as well as explaining \n   \u201csometimes the reason women go back is simply because they\u2019re in love\u201d\n and in case all that wasn\u2019t e-fucking-nough you add in a whoopsie baby (another NA per usual) to serve as the wake-up call that maybe it\u2019d be a good idea to ditch this zero and eventually find you a hero, buuuuuuuuuuuut you just come to an agreement regarding visitation and whathaveyou rather than involving the court and much needed supervised interaction because you know he wouldn\u2019t hurt the baby since it\u2019s obvious he loves her . . . . \n  Nope. I\u2019m well aware I\u2019m going against the grain here. I give zero fucks. Don\u2019t bother trolling me to tell me how stupid I am (especially if you\u2019re a teenager who has lived a privileged lifestyle and never experienced anything contained in this book for yourself).

I was 100 percent team Ryle from the very first time we met him. Just like Lily, I fell in love with every word and every gesture that rolled off of his body. I. WAS. HOOKED. It also didn't help that I kept fantasizing Doctor Mike as Ryle Kincaid. *heart eyes emoji* I loved his ambition. His personality. His confidence. To be honest, I think I might've loved Ryle even more than Lily did but that's another story for another day. That more than likely explains why I took the second half of this book like a blow to the gut.Once we got to the second half of the book, that's where it started going a bit downhill for me as a Ryle and Lily shipper. Every happy moment that ever happened between my ship came barreling down as it collided with pain and abuse. I was angry. I was thrashing. I was yelling at the pages in front of me, \"Why are you doing this Colleen?!\" But most importantly, I was just heartbroken to see such a beautiful couple become so toxic. Everything I loved about the first half of the book was slowly unraveling right before my very eyes as if it never really existed in the first place. I can't even remember how many times I wanted to put the book down because my hopeless romantic self just couldn't handle it anymore. But I just kept on reading because I was guiltily hoping that Ryle and Lily would still have their happy ending despite all that had happened. :/ Sadly, this was where I was torn the most.I have the upmost respect for Lily. She is definitely one of my favorite female characters that Colleen has ever created because she did what a lot of us would've struggled to do in the end: walk away. Lily was such a strong character and I admire her so much for having the strength to stand up for herself. There were numerous times towards the end of the book where I knew I probably would've gave in and forgave Ryle for his actions but Lily was inflexible. She was in a tough position but she put her foot down and demanded better for herself. In the end, no matter if I ship Ryle/Lily or Atlas/Lily, I'm glad that Lily was able to find peace for her and Emmy.As for Atlas, I liked him but I didn't love him. Definitely nowhere near my love for Ryle. I wasn't exactly rooting for Atlas but I wouldn't have minded if Lily chose him in the end. However, I still very much preferred Ryle regardless. I just felt that Atlas was the typical knight in shining armor. Typical good guy you run to. His background story was interesting but him as a character... not so much. He just felt so ordinary and predictable. I wanted to ship Atlas and Lily because let's face it, the signs were practically being shoved down our throats, and although the relationship between Ryle and Lily was developing, Atlas's presence was a like a thorn on your side you just couldn't shake off. But I just couldn't bring myself to ship them blindly like I did with Ryle and Lily.Unfortunately, I was too far gone and too far in love with the idea of Ryle and Lily to make room for Atlas and because of that, I'm not sure if I'll ever be fully satisfied with that ending. I was happy that Lily was no longer a victim of domestic abuse. I'm glad that after all that happened between them, Lily and Ryle parted on good terms. I'll forever be heartbroken over the idea of what could've been. And I feel indifferent to Lily and Atlas. Sorry not sorry, Atlas. That basically sums up all my feelings in a nutshell.To be honest, I was actually feeling a bit more bitter than I'm making it seem after that ending. But after reading the author's note, it really put things in perspective for me and made me look at the story with brand new eyes. I developed a new understanding and appreciation for the story behind the story.I was dying for Ryle and Lily to have their happy ending. Until the very end, I was still rooting for them. It's such an ugly confession to make especially when the couple you're rooting for is toxic and abusive. And I think I feel this way because I never, and hopefully I never will, had to experience abuse. I don't know what it's like and what goes on in the minds of the abused. Colleen did such an excellent job at creating the perfectly imperfect man that was Ryle. Abuse in books has always been a trigger for me and if it were any other book I think I would've put this book down by the first incident of abuse. But Colleen just made you fall so deeply in love with a character that even you couldn't bring yourself to hate him even if you wanted to. YOU were the Lily of this story. But unfortunately, I don't think my Lily would've had the courage to leave. I really wish I could say that I would leave in an instant, but I think I would honestly be lying to myself. You can tell yourself that if you were in Lily's position you would leave in a blink of an eye, but things wouldn't be as easily said and done if you were the one who was actually experiencing it all. And in truth, I think this is exactly what Colleen wanted us to actually sit down and think about because victims who've experienced abuse wouldn't be rooting for Ryle and Lily. I wouldn't be rooting for Ryle and Lily. It just goes to show how much of a struggle it really is to walk away from someone you love and loves you back in all the wrong ways. I usually never read the author's notes after the book but I'm really glad I took the time to read Colleen's story. It really did make me see the situation from a different perspective.

The word \u2018DIFFERENT\u2019 is just etched into its very essence. I feel like Colleen put part of her story and her soul on a silver platter for us to observe and draw our own conclusions from it and this also became evident within the Author\u2019s Note which, by the way, I wholeheartedly encourage you to read. Hell, no. Scratch that. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ IT ENDS WITH US. Not because of the hype. Not because of the romance. Not because of Colleen\u2019s awesome writing skills.

Plus, its unraveling is perfect.Without being spoilery, I will say this: this book is heavy. This book knifes your heart and twists it until you bleed all your pre-conceived ideas about certain topics straight out the window. I loved Lily. I loved Ryle. But most of all, I loved Lily & Ryle. Their relationship is so complex and layered and I was overwhelmed with feelings at just how perfect they were together. I laughed, I smiled, I felt my heart catch wings and head into the clouds. And then I cried buckets. Then there\u2019s Atlas, which I did not fall in love with, but he just fit the puzzle perfectly and after a while I found him so lovable as well. And yes, I loved Lily & Atlas too. They were like a weak but brilliant rainbow after a storm.\n  \u201cIn the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.\u201d \nNow, now, don\u2019t rush and believe this is some love triangle. I just feel evil now and I will say that YOU HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA MUHAHA. *sobs*I\u2019m not saying more because you should definitely head in blind with this one, as I did. Honorary mentions are needed, however: Alyssa, I swear, she\u2019s the best friend I could possibly imagine; I cannot comprehend how difficult it must have been to say and do some things considering the unique dynamics of her with the other characters; Marshall was another great addition that simply showed how easily men can empower women too; and Lily\u2019s mother is a glorious character. And I will share this: there was one particular scene that left me crying like there\u2019s no tomorrow. The last hospital scene. That beautiful and so very ugly and just 100% gut-wrenching scene. Where decisions were made in the hopes of a better future. Where letting go was worth the love you\u2019ve built piece by piece. Where the cycle of history stopped. Where I had to put the book down and start a sobfest. It gutted me, completely and utterly gutted me. \n  \u201cAnd as hard as this choice is, we break the pattern before the pattern breaks us.\u201d\nI read this book in 5 hours. I finished it 24 hours ago. I still can\u2019t stop thinking about it and my stomach is still churning like ashes have taken residence there. I\u2019m an emotional mess. I feel unsatisfied, yet content. Enraged, yet peaceful. This book shows the good, the bad, the in-between. It shows life and love and hatred. It shows how love can become a poison. It shows how love can shackle and hurt, but also save and heal. Honestly, it blew my mind. It doesn\u2019t matter that it made me uncomfortable or that it made me wish things ended up differently. This story needed to exist exactly as it is no matter how broken my heart feels. It is brave and bold.It\u2019s an eye-opener. I realized upon reading that I might have been indifferent or dismissive or downright judgmental regarding some statistics (this sounds weird, I know, but you\u2019ll get it once you read). I never fully grasped some scenarios or some perspectives, but It Ends With Us changed that. It changed me, undoubtedly. And for that, thank you, Colleen. Thank you, Lily. Thank you for making me a better person."}, {"userName": "Kainat \u300aHUFFLEPUFF & PROUD\u300b", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14717996-kainat-hufflepuff-proud", "userReview": "\"Everything Shatters. My tears, my heart, my laughter, my soul. Shattered like broken glass, raining down around me.\" \nAt least now the title makes sense! Boy, do i have a few thing to say about this It Ends With Us! When i decided to give this a second chance this is not what i had on mind. It wasn't supposed to happen, damn it. First of all, this Goodreads synopsis is misleading. It needs to be replaced. Whoever came up with it deserves getting fired. What is the matter with GR users?! First, ACoMaF wins \"best YA fantasy\" award, then this.. THIS!! won Goodreads Choice \"Romance\"? What's wrong with you people?! Let's get one thing straight, THIS IS NOT A ROMANCE! This \"award\" was the reason why I've been somewhat skeptical for this long. Why i was so disappointed in Hoover's other book, Ugly Love, is because THIS is what i was expecting from Ugly Love. This has it all. This is what i call love at it's worst. Don't get me wrong, there were love and a dreadful \"love story\", I still won't call it a romance. I can't thank enough Hoover for not romanticizing abusive behaviors. Thank you, Colleen! No, i am not someone who has dealt with anything like this personally, but i am someone who always asks the question \"why stay with someone if aren't treating you with the respect you deserve?\" I'd like to say i am a bit more aware that it's not always that easy. Still not fully convinced, but a little closer. baby steps, people, baby steps. First half was a bit boring & fairly predictable, to be completely honest. It felt like just another typical CH romance. In fact, it wasn't until the last quarter when i started seeing what Hoover was aiming for. Lilly is a very strong character with hidden depths. I am astonished & extremely proud of her. Ryle, on the other hand, is much more complex. No, i don't hate him. If anything, i'm grief-stricken. The ending was perfect. That's what impressed me the most. Last but not least, thank you, Mary, for putting up with me.

I don't think I've seen a single one of your talk show episodes all the way through. I catch five or six-minute clips here and there posted every so often on Facebook, and I have loved every single one of them, so I don't know why I haven't watched more. You're totally awesome. And another confession: I haven't seen Finding Dory yet, either, even though I loved Finding Nemo. So, yeah, I'm sorry about that too.But I'm so curious right now if you've read It End With Us by Colleen Hoover, since you know, you're such a big part of the story. The way she incorporated you into everything, with the \"just keep swimming\" line and watching episodes of your show and the writing letters to you thing to show the backstory, that was really weird but also different and unique (sorry, I know those two words mean the same thing, but I had to use both anyway). I ended up liking your role in the book a lot. But I'm beginning to believe CoHo has a really evil, diabolical brain. She schooled me so bad.I went in thinking...well, I don't even know what I went in thinking. But I know I don't think that way anymore. I think my entire way of thinking has changed. I tried to compartmentalize. Oh, this is going to be a romance story. Well...it was and yet it wasn't. Then I thought it was going to be a love triangle like Maybe Someday was, and yet it totally wasn't. When the heroine Lily started going back and forth in time, telling two stories about a girl falling in love with two different boys in two different portions of her life, I thought it was going to be another version of Ugly Love, except maybe twisted with Lily taking on Miles's role. But it totally wasn't.This was not a light-hearted story. It was not an easy, feel-good, happily-ever-after that you can crawl into to escape from reality story. It didn't even have a real definitive HEA. I can list all kinds of things that it wasn't and didn't have, but I can't pin-point exactly what it WAS and DID have, except maybe a lesson in life. I feel as if I just lived what Lily lived through. I feel as if I can never victim blame again when it comes to an abused spouse. I can never automatically think \"why did she stay with him?\" because now I know why. All because of Colleen Hoover's diabolical evilness, now I have experienced falling in love with one of those guys and being hurt by him and loved by him, and yet still excusing and forgiving his actions, not just once, not just twice, but every time. Right up into the very last chapter of the book, I was okay with whatever decision Lily made to stay or not to stay with him, because he really wasn't a bad guy. He just did some bad things. And what she did decide was good, but sad, and yet...I don't even know. But I was okay with it. So yeah...I'm really curious how you feel about being mixed up in all this heaviness and serious-issue business. Personally, it's not the kind of story I usually like to read. Stuff that's just too real like that usually gives me hives, and I doubt I want to go out looking for any more stories like this, but I can't say I regret it either. It was just that amazing and just that powerful. Like I said, I was totally schooled by it, and now I go forth with a different outlook on relationships and love and hurting the people who are the closest to you. But I wouldn't want to be schooled this way with every book. I really do need that unrealistic escape more often than not.But I think it was really neat how important you were in the lives of these characters, Ellen, just by being famous and throwing out some witty lines like you do. It really makes you think how everything you say and do can make such an impact on a complete stranger's life, just like Colleen Hoover has now made in mine. And now I feel the need to find some light, fluffy, happy crap to console myself with after reading that life-altering experience.

Because of that fact this isn\u2019t going to be written like my normal reviews, it will be about me and Lily. It will be a correlation of our lives.As I read this book the little broken girl inside me started coming out. I wanted to put her back. I didn\u2019t want her resurface. I needed her to go back to her hiding place where the adult Danielle wouldn\u2019t find her\u2026 She came out nonetheless.I spent my childhood from 6 months to 12 years old in a 3 bedroom, 2 1/2 bathroom, 2 car garage house from hell. My mother had a job at a warehouse and my step-father owned his own construction company. We went to church every Sunday where my step-father\u2019s brother was the preacher. We were clean, never hungry and went on family vacations. It looked perfect from the outside. But the inside was a completely different story.Unlike Lily, my step-father\u2019s abuse reached my brother, sister, and me. I learned from an early age how to take a few blows from a man. It became so normal that they didn\u2019t even hurt anymore.But let\u2019s talk about It Ends With Us\u2026I fell in love with Ryle during the beginning of the book. He was sexy, smart, good in bed \u2013 everything I girl could ask for. He was attentive even with his busy schedule at the hospital. He worked for Lily\u2019s heart and never took her love for granted.Lily was funny as hell. I loved her from the first paragraph. I thought, \u201cThis is a chick I could rock with.\u201d Plus she was a red head. My inner lesbian has a thing for red heads. She was a badass. She was a woman who knew her self-worth and I loved that about her.When the two of them came together it was pure magic. Here\u2019s this man who doesn\u2019t want anything that resembles love in his life but couldn\u2019t help himself from falling in love with her. That\u2019s one of my favorite things to read about and to see in real life.Atlas, Atlas, Atlas! He was just\u2026 perfection! I want an Atlas when I grow up. I really enjoyed reading Lily\u2019s letters to Ellen Degeneres. Getting inside Lily\u2019s head, seeing Atlas the way she did made me love him too. I became so conflicted as to who I wanted Lily to be with.\n  \n    From this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health, until death do us part.\u201dMaybe those vows weren\u2019t meant to be taken as literally as some spouses that time.For better, for worse?Fuck.That.Shit.\n  \nI\u2019ll be honest, it was hard to hate Ryle. Even after everything he did there was a piece of me who hoped he could change. I think that that scared little girl in me wanted to believe he would stop, like I prayed my step-father would.This is one of those books everyone has to read for themselves to find their voice on it.

I said I wasn't going to cry, I cried a little. NO SPOILERSThis book is very deep. It touched on some strong subjects. I would like to add so many excerpts (good and bad) but I'm not going to do that either. I would like for those that haven't read the book yet to go into it without knowing too much. There are two people in the book I didn't like, one is from Lily's past (her father) and one is from her current life (Ryle)I very much loved: 1) Atlas2) Atlas 3) Atlas4) Allysa5) Marshall6) Brad7) Darin8) Jimmy9) Lily's MomObviously, I really loved Atlas because I added his name three times (there are not three of him). Allysa is Ryle's sister and Marshall is her husband. Allysa becomes best friends with Lily and helps Lily with the opening of her flower shop and works there with her for some time. Brad, Darin and Jimmy are characters that are only in the book for a short period of time, but that short period had me laughing out loud and I really needed that with all of the deep stuff in the book. Lily's mom had many issues to deal with but I still loved her because she was a good person. Letting bad things happen to you doesn't make you a bad person. The story goes back and forth from when Lily was younger (teens) and when she's a little older. There are a lot of bad things that happened in her childhood. She also meets Atlas when she's a teenager too. They both have troubles they are going through but they had a wonderful bond. I'm going to leave it at that because there are so many strong emotions I have over this book, I'm afraid to say anything else. I loved it and I hated it. And it has the most wonderful ending!

This book left me completely speechless. It's why this review will be far from eloquent and admittedly a little short. I've been staring at the cursor as it blinks in silence on my computer screen, trying to come up with a review for this unbelievably complex, astonishingly real, and heart wrenching novel. I can't decide what I want to tell you and I think that's because I really \n  don't want to tell anything at all.\nI went into It Ends with Us with a clear head and absolutely no idea on what was going to happen. It's best that way. This novel is one of those reads that simply knocks you out cold. It's a heavy handed, physical blast to the feels (aka: emotions). You cannot catch your breath while reading. It's settles you into an easy reading pace, makes you feel good, cocoons you in it's warmth, and then when you think you're happy and safe, you're not. It EVISCERATES you. It tears you down piece by piece until you're left confused, torn, broken, thinking, \"I can't believe this is happening. I don't believe it. I don't want to believe it.\" I still can't get over it. I still can't process the fact that it threw me so off center. And when I describe this book to people, I keep repeating, \"It's heart breaking, but hopeful.\" And I know that doesn't seem really comforting. It doesn't tell you much at all. But here's the thing, I don't want to get into Ryle or Atlas or Lily or the characters in this book. I don't want to break them down piece by piece. I don't want to plant seeds or ideas in your head. I don't want to influence your reading experience. I want you to go in. I want you to READ. I want you to EXPERIENCE it with the same innocence and naivety that I did. I want it to sucker punch you. I want it to ruin you. I want it to heal you. I want you to \n  LIVE\n this through Lily's eyes, heart, and mind just like I did.

So many feelings I'm dying to share.And way too many thoughts clouding my mind.This is definitely a book that needs to be discussed thoroughly, but not in a review. Not at the chance of ruining the experience for someone else. This is one that you\u2019ll want to share with your friends, your sister and maybe even your mother. At least, that\u2019s how I felt. Whether or not you ever find yourself in this situation, chances are, you might know someone who is. For me, the beauty of this book was the author\u2019s ability to change my perspective. To go from a place of judgment to one of confusion, agony and ultimately understanding. It made me step back and look at a situation that should have been cut and dry or black and white and consider every shade of gray. I\u2019m not going to lie, my headspace was a complete mess and my heart ached. I wanted so desperately for things to be different. For things to be easy. For the right choice to be blatantly obvious. To forgive and forget. To give in to those feelings and accept the bad with the hope that the good would somehow make up for it in the end. This story really hit home with the notion that love is what makes things hard sometimes, not the hurt. Love has the power to blur the lines of acceptance. \n  \u201cNaked truths aren\u2019t always pretty.\u201d\nMY NAKED TRUTH: I told myself awhile ago, I was done with CoHo. That I would never read another of her books, ever. And there was a part of me that almost managed to forget the addictive quality of her writing. Almost. I can honestly say, this was a powerful book. One I\u2019m better for reading. It managed to make me look at things a little differently and I love that. I appreciate that.

(If anyone has a shot of fighting his abusive infliction it would be an extremely intelligent and educated man who has a solid family to support him and a strong will and reasons to do so.) From reading the author's note for the third time last night she wanted to pattern him around her father but her father was an alcoholic who if I read it right didn't help her mother financially when she left or the kids. I think perhaps she didn't go hard enough with Ryle's character because I do think a therapist would find all his qualities, smart, driven, no drug or alcohol problem in the mix, strong support system and will to change a perfect patient to overcome his rage. Also, Atlas was so darn convenient just there on the outer rim of this story waiting to bounce back into Lily\u2019s world. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I liked him a lot but the love connection for me was with Ryle not her childhood friend. Though the ending between Ryle and Lily worked for me it was heartbreaking yet real and I cried and cried for them. To my shock it seems that I read this one a certain way and double the number of friends read it as Atlas and Lily\u2019s love story from the get go.

It is filled with SO many heartbreaking moments I didn\u2019t think my heart could endure it all.I read this book a few weeks back, and it has stayed with me since. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, it is truly one of those stories that will surely stay with me for a very very long time. It made me question things and situations I never thought I would even think twice about. It made me love people I didn\u2019t think were worthy of love and forgive things I didn\u2019t think were forgivable.As always with Colleen\u2019s writing, each of her characters has a distinct voice and each story has a distinct message. It Ends With Us, for me at least, reminded me how easy it is in life to point a finger. To judge someone or a situation you are on the outside of. So easy to say, \u201cIf that was me, I wouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d But this story shows us that sometimes certain situations aren\u2019t that easy to walk away from and become even messier when emotions and love are involved. \n  I applaud Colleen so much for writing a story like this. In fact, she deserves a freaking standing ovation.\n In a world with MCs, twists, and plots that are all so similar they all begin to mesh as one, It Ends With Us stands out with its personal, exceedingly touching, and original storyline.I don\u2019t want to say anything on plot or characters. I read this not knowing a thing on either, and was shocked to see how it unfolded. And even though I won\u2019t elaborate on any details and in turn my review is very brief, I really think those who go in blind will appreciate the story and the insanely strong emotion behind it that much more.Go in with an open mind.Go in with an open heart.

I was still too sleepy-tired to put my eyes to work reading from my kindle or a physical book. Plus ....I knew I was almost at the very end of this story. Paul said, \"sure\". He had listened to part of this book on our drive to and from Felton early this morning- to \"Fall Creek\"... where we hiked 2.5 hours. He was aware - taking in - much of this story too. Right when the issues - messages - of this novel had hit me the hardest-- Paul was lying next to me. HE HEARD WHAT WAS GOING ON. - WE DISCUSSED THE issues - at some point - later - but at that moment, I turned off the audio - not wanting to get to the VERY END...even though - by now - I KNEW WHAT was coming .....and I reached for Paul to snuggle. I had never felt more grateful and thankful. I wanted to cry - didn't - but felt an urge. I WISHED I COULD TELL EVERY WOMAN ON THIS PLANET THAT I FELT CONNECTED TO THEM!!!

As readers, we are given a unique perspective into a very difficult issue. One that unfortunately, is not all that uncommon. Ms. Hoover doesn't take the easy route either. No. We are drawn in. We commit to the characters. We feel their love. We feel their devastation. We feel their heartbreak. We feel their confusion. We feel their healing. To say this is an emotional rollercoaster is an understatement. I won't lie to you and tell you that you won't have your heart torn out right along with the heroine.

That's what I found so impactful. The introspection I was forced to face: that things are not black and white and that those murky gray areas can be devastating. I admit that I was hesitant to pick this up, sensing that like my friends, I would be subject to an involuntary emotional cleanse. However, I can't bring myself to be anything but appreciative for this story. It's a story that belongs to many: those who made a similar choice as Lily, those that didn't, and those that have paid the consequences when they weren't the one to make the decisions.
